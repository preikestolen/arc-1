# Test Suite Audit

Date: 2026-05-11
Repository: `marianfoo/arc-1`
Baseline commit: `85112917` (`chore(main): release 0.9.5 (#266)`)
Target SAP system used: A4H/S4 test system via local infrastructure credentials.

## Executive Summary

The suite is much healthier than the earlier April reliability audit, but there are still material gaps:

- The main unit, integration, and E2E suites all pass against the live S4 system.
- Current totals: 2,881 unit tests, 236 integration tests, and 137 E2E tests.
- Unit skips are gone. E2E skip rate is low at 2.2%. Integration skip rate is 17.4%, but 33 of 41 integration skips are BTP tests in an S4-only run.
- There are still real pseudo-skip bugs in E2E tests: several tests print `[SKIP]` or return early while Vitest records them as passed.
- Cleanup is not good enough for a long-lived shared SAP system. The current run left at least one open E2E transport and one integration transport, and the live system already has many older `ZARC1*` leftovers.
- E2E fixture setup can recreate invalid CDS fixtures, log activation failures as warnings, and still report `skipped=0`. This is the highest-risk harness issue found.
- Runtime hotspots are concentrated and actionable: integration cache warmup, recursive transport release, E2E RAP write lifecycle, E2E where-used navigation, and E2E transport release.
- Coverage is operational but still weak around HTTP/auth/server/BTP paths. Overall branch coverage is 71.59%; `src/server/http.ts`, `src/server/server.ts`, `src/adt/btp.ts`, and `src/extract-sap-cookies.ts` should be next.
- A second-pass live cleanup reconciliation found current-run E2E transient object cleanup mostly worked: successful E2E creates were followed by successful deletes except the managed persistent fixtures. The unresolved cleanup problem is old residue plus transports plus inactive persistent fixtures.

## Evidence Log

### Repository State

- Current worktree was clean before this report file was added.
- Dependencies were installed with `npm ci`.
- Install warning: `lint-staged@17.0.4` requires Node `>=22.22.1`; local Node is `v22.21.1`.
- No committed `.env` was present in this worktree.
- Local S4 credentials were injected for live tests without writing secrets to the repo.

### Earlier Audit Baseline

Previous reliability work is documented in:

- `docs/research/test-reliability-audit-points-2-7.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-1-reliability-telemetry.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-2-skip-policy-pseudo-skips.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-3-coverage-ci-signal.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-4-trycatch-signal-quality.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-5-crud-lifecycle.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-6-btp-stability.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-7-docs-verification.md`
- `docs/plans/completed/test-reliability-audit-points-2-7-hardening.md`

The previous audit found skipped-test drift, pseudo-skips, missing coverage infrastructure, weak try/catch assertions, and missing CRUD/BTP coverage. Most of that was addressed, but some drift has returned.

## Test Runs

### Unit

Command: `npm test`

Result:

- Files: 83 passed.
- Tests: 2,881 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed.
- Duration: 9.37s.
- JSON: `test-results/unit.json`.

Largest unit runtimes:

| File | Tests | Runtime | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `tests/unit/adt/http.test.ts` | 113 | 11.1s | Dominates unit runtime; likely intentional timeout/retry coverage but worth checking for fake timers. |
| `tests/unit/handlers/intent.test.ts` | 561 | 3.7s | Large but valuable router coverage. |
| `tests/unit/lint/lint-e2e.test.ts` | 24 | 0.6s | Acceptable. |

### Integration

Command: `npm run test:integration` with A4H/S4 credentials.

Result:

- Files: 11 passed, 2 skipped.
- Tests: 195 passed, 41 skipped, 0 failed.
- Duration: 320.07s.
- JSON: `test-results/integration.json`.

By file:

| File | Passed | Skipped | Runtime | Review |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` | 20 | 0 | 122.7s | Main integration hotspot; repeated live warmups. |
| `tests/integration/adt.integration.test.ts` | 99 | 2 | 77.6s | Broad live ADT coverage; two legitimate backend/fixture skips. |
| `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts` | 8 | 4 | 54.5s | Runtime dominated by recursive release; also leaves transports. |
| `tests/integration/crud.lifecycle.integration.test.ts` | 5 | 0 | 20.9s | Good CRUD lifecycle signal. |
| `tests/integration/context.integration.test.ts` | 19 | 0 | 13.4s | Good coverage for context/probe features. |
| `tests/integration/fugr-func-params.integration.test.ts` | 2 | 0 | 6.0s | Passes, but internal skip calls lack reasons. |
| `tests/integration/fugr-func.integration.test.ts` | 3 | 0 | 5.9s | Passes, but internal skip calls lack reasons. |
| `tests/integration/abapgit.integration.test.ts` | 5 | 2 | 1.7s | Two hard-coded `it.skip()` tests remain. |
| `tests/integration/audit-logging.integration.test.ts` | 7 | 0 | 1.0s | Good. |
| `tests/integration/gcts.integration.test.ts` | 6 | 0 | 1.0s | Good. |
| `tests/integration/elicitation.integration.test.ts` | 21 | 0 | 0.0s | Unit-like integration coverage; good. |
| `tests/integration/btp-abap.integration.test.ts` | 0 | 28 | 0.0s | Expected skipped in S4-only run. |
| `tests/integration/btp-abap.smoke.integration.test.ts` | 0 | 5 | 0.0s | Expected skipped in S4-only run. |

Skip interpretation:

- 33/41 skips are BTP-only tests because BTP service key configuration was not provided for this S4 run.
- 8/203 non-BTP integration tests skipped (3.9%).
- `tests/integration/abapgit.integration.test.ts:95` and `:100` are permanent hard skips for stage/pull.
- Four transport tests skipped because optional `TEST_TRANSPORT_PACKAGE` / `TEST_TRANSPORT_OBJECT_NAME` inputs were not configured.
- Two ADT skips were backend/fixture dependent.

Follow-up targeted transport-package run:

- Command: `npx vitest run --config vitest.integration.config.ts tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts` with `TEST_TRANSPORT_PACKAGE=Z_LLM_TEST_PACKAGE`.
- Result: 11 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed, 63.26s.
- This closed the package-gated auto-corrNr behavior: both `update succeeds without explicit transport` and `explicit transport overrides lock corrNr` passed.
- Remaining skip: reverse lookup for a transportable class object because no `TEST_TRANSPORT_OBJECT_NAME` class fixture was configured; the package currently contains PROG entries, while the test hard-codes a class URL.
- Important: this focused run overwrote `test-results/integration.json`; the full-suite integration counts above are from the earlier full run output.

### E2E

Command: `npm run test:e2e:full` with A4H/S4 credentials.

Result:

- Files: 16 passed.
- Tests: 134 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed.
- Duration: 424.95s.
- JSON: `test-results/e2e.json`.
- JUnit: `/tmp/arc1-e2e-logs/junit-results.xml`.

By file:

| File | Passed | Skipped | Runtime | Review |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` | 9 | 0 | 127.7s | Slowest E2E file; broad write/activate/delete lifecycle. |
| `tests/e2e/navigate.e2e.test.ts` | 11 | 2 | 80.8s | Expensive where-used queries; two live backend skips. |
| `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts` | 13 | 1 | 54.6s | Creates/deletes/releases transports; first created transport is not cleaned up. |
| `tests/e2e/ddic-write.e2e.test.ts` | 6 | 0 | 29.8s | Cleanup looked good for current run. |
| `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts` | 13 | 0 | 29.4s | Contains a weak "fresh dump" test that can pass via old dumps. |
| `tests/e2e/func-write.e2e.test.ts` | 4 | 0 | 17.3s | Current-run cleanup looked good. |
| `tests/e2e/smoke.e2e.test.ts` | 28 | 0 | 13.4s | Good broad smoke coverage. |
| `tests/e2e/sktd-write.e2e.test.ts` | 4 | 0 | 12.8s | Current run passed, but has pseudo-skips if SKTD unsupported. |
| `tests/e2e/rap.e2e.test.ts` | 10 | 0 | 12.2s | Good read/write smoke for RAP features. |
| `tests/e2e/func-params.e2e.test.ts` | 2 | 0 | 11.3s | Current-run cleanup looked good. |
| `tests/e2e/cds-context.e2e.test.ts` | 6 | 0 | 8.4s | Good CDS read/context coverage. |
| `tests/e2e/cache.e2e.test.ts` | 9 | 0 | 6.0s | Good E2E cache behavior. |
| `tests/e2e/activation-failure.e2e.test.ts` | 1 | 0 | 6.0s | Valuable regression, but has false-pass skip branches. |
| `tests/e2e/cds-impact.e2e.test.ts` | 4 | 0 | 3.8s | Passed despite inactive local fixtures; setup validity should be enforced. |
| `tests/e2e/sap-git.e2e.test.ts` | 8 | 0 | 1.8s | Good read/safety coverage. |
| `tests/e2e/revisions.e2e.test.ts` | 6 | 0 | 1.8s | Good revision read coverage. |

Actual E2E skips:

- `tests/e2e/navigate.e2e.test.ts`: reference lookup for `ZCL_ARC1_TEST`.
- `tests/e2e/navigate.e2e.test.ts`: definition lookup of interface reference in class source.
- `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts`: transportable package auto-corrNr test, because `TEST_TRANSPORT_PACKAGE` was not set.

### Coverage

## GitHub Actions Runtime Deep Dive

Reference run: <https://github.com/marianfoo/arc-1/actions/runs/25674270461?pr=262><br>
Workflow title: `feat(skills): add SEGW→RAP migration + UI5 modernization + Fiori Elements skills`<br>
Run date: 2026-05-11.<br>
Status: success.

The GitHub UI reports total duration `33m 7s`, but that includes pending/queue time. The run was created at `13:49:14Z`; the first visible jobs started at `14:00:18Z`, so about `11m 04s` was GitHub scheduling/pending time rather than ARC-1 test execution. The actual visible execution path was about `22m`.

Job/step timing from the run metadata:

| Segment | Runtime | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `test (22)` matrix job | 1m15s | Unit/lint/typecheck/coverage on Node 22. Runs in parallel with Node 24. |
| `test (24)` matrix job | 1m12s | Node 24 is slightly faster in this run. |
| `integration` job | 6m39s | `Run integration tests` step was 6m27s. |
| `e2e` job | 13m12s | `Run E2E tests` step was 12m47s. |
| `reliability-summary` | 17s | Artifact download + summary only. |

The critical path after the matrix tests is dominated by live SAP jobs: integration then E2E. The workflow intentionally runs them sequentially, so any runtime reduction has to come from test selection, less repeated SAP work, cleanup, or carefully isolated read-only parallelism.

### CI Integration Runtime

Artifact used: `test-results-integration/integration.json` from run `25674270461`.

Totals:

- Tests: 236 total, 195 passed, 41 skipped.
- File wall-time sum: 362.5s.
- Assertion duration sum: 359.2s.
- GitHub step time: 387s, so runner/Vitest overhead was about 24.5s.

Top integration files:

| File | Runtime | Share of file time | Main cause |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` | 134.2s | 37.0% | Repeated live `runWarmup()` scans. |
| `tests/integration/adt.integration.test.ts` | 92.7s | 25.6% | Broad live ADT write/read coverage. |
| `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts` | 73.0s | 20.1% | Recursive release and transport list/get calls. |
| `tests/integration/crud.lifecycle.integration.test.ts` | 26.8s | 7.4% | Expected live CRUD lifecycle cost. |
| `tests/integration/context.integration.test.ts` | 16.9s | 4.7% | Live context/dependency calls. |

Slowest integration tests:

| Runtime | Test |
|---:|---|
| 46.5s | `transport.integration.test.ts` > `releaseTransportRecursive` > `recursively releases a transport` |
| 45.9s | `cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `second warmup run skips unchanged objects (delta by hash)` |
| 25.4s | `cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `TADIR query returns custom CLAS/INTF objects (Z prefix)` |
| 23.8s | `cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `warmup indexes objects into cache` |
| 22.7s | `cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `warmup sets isWarmupAvailable flag` |
| 14.1s | `adt.integration.test.ts` > `edit_method against class includes` |
| 11.8s | `adt.integration.test.ts` > `SAPWrite batch_create activateAtEnd=true` |
| 10.9s | `transport.integration.test.ts` > `getTransport returns transport details` |
| 10.4s | `transport.integration.test.ts` > `listTransports lists transports for current user` |

Integration runtime conclusions:

- `cache.integration.test.ts` is the biggest controllable integration cost. It runs multiple full warmups against `$TMP`, and `$TMP` grows as old test residue accumulates. Runtime will drift upward unless warmup scope is bounded.
- The delta-warmup behavior does not need a live scan in every PR. It is mostly cache/hash logic and should move to unit tests with a small mocked object set.
- The transport recursive-release test is expensive and mutates global CTS state. It should not be on the default PR path unless transport release code changed.
- `listTransports` and `getTransport` are slower than they should be because they operate against a polluted transport organizer. Cleaning old `ARC-1` transport residue is a runtime improvement, not just a hygiene fix.

### CI E2E Runtime

Artifacts used: `test-results-e2e/e2e.json`, `e2e-junit/junit-results.xml`, and `e2e-logs/mcp-server.log` from run `25674270461`.

Totals:

- Tests: 137 total, 134 passed, 3 skipped.
- File wall-time sum from Vitest JSON: 718.8s.
- JUnit suite time: 738.1s.
- GitHub `Run E2E tests` step: 767s.
- The extra ~48s is mostly fixture sync plus npm/Vitest startup and report overhead. The server log shows fixture reconciliation starting at `14:09:08Z` and the first test-like feature probe after managed fixture checks at about `14:09:32Z`, so fixture sync alone cost roughly 24s in this run.

Top E2E files:

| File | Runtime | Share of file time | Main cause |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` | 208.7s | 29.0% | Repeated create/activate/read/delete RAP stacks. |
| `tests/e2e/navigate.e2e.test.ts` | 158.5s | 22.0% | Broad standard where-used queries. |
| `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts` | 83.9s | 11.7% | Recursive release and full transport list. |
| `tests/e2e/ddic-write.e2e.test.ts` | 47.0s | 6.5% | Live DDIC create/delete lifecycle. |
| `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts` | 44.4s | 6.2% | ATC and dump-detail calls. |
| `tests/e2e/func-write.e2e.test.ts` | 29.7s | 4.1% | FUGR/FUNC create/update/delete. |
| `tests/e2e/smoke.e2e.test.ts` | 28.6s | 4.0% | Broad smoke coverage. |
| `tests/e2e/sktd-write.e2e.test.ts` | 24.7s | 3.4% | SKTD + DDLS lifecycle. |

Slowest E2E tests:

| Runtime | Test |
|---:|---|
| 52.9s | `navigate.e2e.test.ts` > references to `BAPIRET2` |
| 52.0s | `rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > create SRVB, activate, publish, unpublish, delete |
| 46.6s | `saptransport.e2e.test.ts` > `release_recursive releases transport` |
| 37.3s | `rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > create DDLS CDS view entity + BDEF |
| 36.0s | `navigate.e2e.test.ts` > `BAPIRET2` references filtered by `CLAS/OC` |
| 30.6s | `navigate.e2e.test.ts` > references to `T000` |
| 26.1s | `rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > DCLS lifecycle |
| 25.8s | `rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > create SRVD service definition |
| 25.6s | `saptransport.e2e.test.ts` > `SAPTransport list` |
| 24.6s | `rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > `batch_create` for table entity + CDS view + DCL |
| 23.5s | `sktd-write.e2e.test.ts` > SKTD full CRUD lifecycle |
| 22.5s | `func-params.e2e.test.ts` > FUNC structured-parameter lifecycle |

Server-log tool timing confirms the same hotspots:

| Tool/status | Calls | Total runtime | Average | Max |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `SAPWrite:success` | 93 | 250.8s | 2.70s | 10.8s |
| `SAPNavigate:success` | 10 | 156.2s | 15.62s | 52.8s |
| `SAPRead:success` | 69 | 96.9s | 1.40s | 4.7s |
| `SAPTransport:success` | 14 | 83.3s | 5.95s | 45.6s |
| `SAPActivate:success` | 30 | 61.7s | 2.06s | 3.1s |
| `SAPDiagnose:success` | 13 | 35.9s | 2.76s | 14.9s |
| `SAPManage:success` | 8 | 23.1s | 2.88s | 6.9s |

E2E runtime conclusions:

- The largest class of E2E time is not test-runner overhead; it is real SAP mutation cost. `SAPWrite` plus `SAPActivate` account for about 312s of server-recorded time.
- `navigate.e2e.test.ts` repeatedly asks the SAP where-used index for very broad standard objects. `BAPIRET2` is queried twice and costs ~89s combined. `T000` adds another ~31s.
- `SAPManage probe` is called multiple times even though the server already runs startup feature probing. The E2E tests that only need cached availability should use `SAPManage features` instead.
- `SAPTransport list` is now a performance problem because old test transports have accumulated. Cleanup will reduce both runtime and nondeterminism.

### Runtime Improvement Options From This Run

Highest-confidence, low-risk changes:

1. Replace repeated E2E `SAPManage probe` calls with `SAPManage features` where the test only needs feature availability.
   - Affects `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` and `tests/e2e/cds-impact.e2e.test.ts`.
   - Keep one explicit `SAPManage probe` smoke in `tests/e2e/smoke.e2e.test.ts`.
   - Expected saving from this run: roughly 12-14s.
2. Split the recursive transport release tests out of the default PR path.
   - Affects one integration test and one E2E test.
   - Expected saving: ~46s integration and ~47s E2E.
   - Keep them in `test:integration:transport` / `test:e2e:transport` or a nightly/manual profile.
3. Stop testing broad `BAPIRET2` where-used twice.
   - Keep one broad `BAPIRET2` or `T000` where-used test as a live smoke.
   - Move objectType-filter behavior to unit tests and/or reuse the unfiltered result inside the file.
   - Expected saving if only one broad standard where-used remains: 60-90s E2E.
4. Replace full transport-list assumptions with test-owned transport assertions.
   - Create a transport, get it directly, then delete it.
   - Avoid using `listTransports()` as a prerequisite for `getTransport`.
   - Clean old `ARC-1` transports so the remaining list smoke is cheap.
   - Expected saving after cleanup: 15-35s across integration/E2E.

Medium-risk but high-value changes:

1. Rework `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` around one shared live warmup.
   - Today it runs multiple live scans: broad TADIR enumeration, index warmup, flag warmup, second-delta warmup, and usage warmups.
   - Use one `beforeAll` warmup result for the warmup describe block, then assert `totalObjects`, `fetched`, `sourceCount`, `nodeCount`, `isWarmupAvailable`, and usages from that shared cache.
   - Move "second warmup skips unchanged objects" to a unit test with a mocked client and fixed sources.
   - Add `runWarmup` options for tests: `maxObjects`, `objectTypes`, and possibly `packageFilter` defaults that avoid broad `$TMP`.
   - Expected saving: 80-110s integration.
2. Consolidate RAP write E2E coverage.
   - `rap-write.e2e.test.ts` creates similar table/view stacks several times.
   - Keep one full SRVB publish/unpublish lifecycle in a slow profile.
   - For default PR E2E, keep smaller write smokes: one TABL, one DDLS+BDEF or `batch_create activateAtEnd`, one service definition/binding smoke.
   - Use `batch_create` with `activateAtEnd=true` where cross-object dependencies allow it, so the test pays one create sequence and one activation batch instead of repeated create/activate/read cycles.
   - Drop read-back assertions for intermediate dependencies when the final object already proves the stack activated.
   - Expected saving: 60-120s E2E depending on how much full-stack coverage moves to slow profile.
3. Make fixture sync faster and stricter.
   - This run paid ~24s before Vitest tests started.
   - After fixing activation handling, add a fast mode that checks managed fixtures by one batched lookup/active-state query and only reads full source when fixture files changed or a hash marker differs.
   - Expected saving: 10-20s E2E on steady-state CI runs.

Parallelization guidance from this run:

- Do not enable `fileParallelism` for the current all-in-one integration/E2E configs. The slowest tests mutate shared SAP state, own locks, or touch CTS.
- Parallelize by profile, not by arbitrary file concurrency:
  - `e2e:read`: smoke reads, revisions, SAPGit read/safety, cache, limited diagnostics, limited navigation.
  - `e2e:write`: DDIC/FUNC/SKTD/RAP write lifecycles, still sequential.
  - `e2e:transport`: transport-only, sequential and preferably opt-in.
  - `integration:core`: non-warmup, non-recursive-transport live integration.
  - `integration:slow`: warmup and CTS release behavior.
- If read-only profiles are parallelized, run each shard with its own MCP server and explicit `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT`. Start with two shards and `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT=5` each, then compare server logs for timeout, 5xx, reset, and enqueue categories before increasing.
- The server default `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT=10` is already enough for current serial E2E. Raising it will not reduce serial test time; it only matters after there are concurrent client calls.
- On current `main`, HTTP mode also has Layer 1 ingress rate limiting (`ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`, default `20`, with `/mcp` derived as `max(value * 30, 600)` requests/minute/IP) and optional Layer 2 per-user tool-call limiting (`ARC1_RATE_LIMIT`, default `0`, disabled). Record these settings in any parallelism experiment so a `429` or MCP rate-limit response is not misdiagnosed as SAP backend capacity.

Expected PR-path target after the low/medium-risk changes:

| Area | Current run | Realistic PR-path target | How |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Integration test step | 6m27s | 3m00s-4m00s | Shared/bounded warmup, move recursive release slow. |
| E2E test step | 12m47s | 7m00s-9m00s | Reduce broad navigation, move recursive release/full SRVB slow, use cached features. |
| Critical path after unit matrix | ~20m | ~11m-14m | Same sequencing, less SAP work. |

The fastest safe improvement is not parallelism yet. It is first reducing repeated broad live SAP work, especially cache warmup, broad where-used, recursive CTS release, and full RAP stack creation.

## Findings

### P0 - Fixture Sync Can Report Success After Activation Failure

`tests/e2e/setup.ts:186-191` treats any `SAPActivate` error as an activation warning and returns success. During this run, fixture sync recreated `ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT` and `ZI_ARC1_I33_PROJ`, both failed activation, and the summary still reported `skipped=0`.

Concrete evidence:

- `tests/fixtures/abap/zi_arc1_i33_root.ddls.abap:2` contains `@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true`, which this S/4 system rejects for view entities.
- `ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT` failed activation with "Annotation `AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter` is not allowed in view entities".
- `ZI_ARC1_I33_PROJ` then failed because `ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT` was not active.
- A live inactive-object check after the run found both `ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT` and `ZI_ARC1_I33_PROJ` inactive.

Impact:

- E2E can go green while persistent fixtures are inactive.
- Subsequent runs can repeatedly delete/recreate invalid fixtures.
- Tests depending on those fixtures are not necessarily validating active runtime behavior.

Recommended fix:

- Fix the DDLS fixture source first.
- Make `activateObject()` throw unless the error is classified as a known backend gap.
- Add a post-sync assertion that all non-skipped persistent fixtures are active/readable.

Implementation status (2026-05-28 follow-up PR):

- `tests/fixtures/abap/zi_arc1_i33_root.ddls.abap` now uses only view-entity-compatible annotations.
- `tests/e2e/setup.ts` now treats `SAPActivate` errors as hard fixture-sync failures unless the existing fixture-error classifier recognizes the error.
- Fixture sync now checks `SAPRead(type="INACTIVE_OBJECTS")` after reconciliation and fails if any managed non-skipped fixture remains inactive.
- Fixture sync now verifies created/recreated fixtures are actively readable. Exact post-recreate source equality is intentionally not required because SAP canonicalizes some DDIC source text such as TABL definitions.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` now gives the E2E job 20 minutes. CI run `26543612479` completed all E2E tests in 852.71s but hit the previous 15-minute job timeout during artifact upload and teardown, so the old limit was too tight for the current serial SAP-backed suite.
- `tests/unit/e2e/setup.test.ts` covers activation-error failure, inactive-fixture detection, and the unchanged-fixture success path without requiring SAP credentials.

### P0 - Transport Tests Leave Live SAP Transports

The current run created real transport requests that remain in draft state:

- E2E created `A4HK905131` from `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts:40-59`; no cleanup path deletes or releases that request.
- Integration created `A4HK905123` from `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts:135-142`; `afterAll()` only logs that cleanup is manual at `:125-131`.
- Follow-up package-enabled integration created additional draft transports. Empty transports `A4HK905149` and `A4HK905151` were manually deleted after the research run, but `A4HK905159` and `A4HK905161` remain because their tasks contain locked objects.

Live SAP check after the run found 17 open/draft ARC-1 transport requests listed for the user, including current-run and older runs.

After the package-enabled follow-up and best-effort cleanup, the list contains 19 ARC-1 transport requests. The two new remaining requests are:

- `A4HK905159` (`ARC-1 IT corrNr ...`) with task `A4HK905160` containing locked `PROG ZARC1_TR_6N7NC0`.
- `A4HK905161` (`ARC-1 IT explicit ...`) with task `A4HK905162` containing locked `PROG ZARC1_TR_6N9SK1`.

Those two program names exist in TADIR under `Z_LLM_TEST_PACKAGE`, but `SAPSearch` returns no object and `SAPRead(PROG)` returns 404. This is the exact "ghost row + locked transport task" failure mode the cleanup harness needs to prevent.

Impact:

- The test system accumulates transport requests indefinitely.
- `listTransports` tests become less deterministic as old test data grows.
- Parallel CI or repeated local runs can pollute each other's assumptions.
- Failed cleanup can leave transport tasks undeletable through ARC-1 because the object is locked in CTS but not addressable through the normal ADT program endpoint.

Recommended fix:

- Track created transport IDs in each suite and delete or release them in `finally` / `afterAll`.
- If a transport intentionally must remain, move that test behind an explicit opt-in env var such as `TEST_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_LEAKS=true`.
- Add a post-run transport residue check that fails when new draft `ARC-1 E2E` / `ARC-1 IT` requests remain.
- For transportable-package write tests, cleanup must delete the generated object while it is still addressable and with the correct transport. If cleanup fails, the test should fail instead of logging only.

Implementation status (2026-05-28 follow-up PR):

- `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts` now deletes the transport created by the create/get suite and deletes the transportable-package write request after deleting the generated program.
- `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts` now tracks created transport IDs across the suite and deletes remaining modifiable requests in `afterAll`.
- E2E and integration transport suites now snapshot existing ARC-1 draft transports at startup and fail when the current run leaves new draft transport residue.
- Integration transport object cleanup now fails the suite when generated objects cannot be deleted, instead of logging only.
- Permanent release tests are gated by `TEST_TRANSPORT_RELEASE_TESTS=true` in E2E and integration because released requests cannot be deleted from the shared SAP test system.

### P1 - Real Pseudo-Skips Still Exist

These branches can make tests pass without executing assertions:

- `tests/e2e/sktd-write.e2e.test.ts:57-58`, `:75-76`, `:86-87`, `:97-98`: `if (!sktdSupported) return;`.
- `tests/e2e/activation-failure.e2e.test.ts:69-71` and `:88-90`: logs `[SKIP]` and returns, but the test is recorded as passed.
- `tests/e2e/helpers.ts:205-210`: exported `skipIf()` is unused and its comment says Vitest cannot skip inside a test, which is now outdated.

Recommended fix:

- Add `ctx` to the affected test callbacks and call `ctx.skip('reason')`.
- Delete `skipIf()` or rewrite it to require a Vitest context.
- Add a static test that rejects `[SKIP]` logs paired with bare `return` in test files.

Implementation status:

- A follow-up PR after `#274` converts the SKTD and activation-failure pseudo-skips to real Vitest skips, removes the obsolete `skipIf()` helper, and adds a static unit guard that rejects future `[SKIP]` pseudo-skip markers in integration/E2E/helper test code.

### P1 - Skip Reason Telemetry Is Misleading

`scripts/ci/collect-test-reliability.mjs:44-47` uses `test.title` as the skip reason. Vitest JSON does not include the actual `ctx.skip()` message, and the JUnit report also emitted blank skip messages in this run.

Impact:

- The reliability summary says "Top Skip Reasons", but it is actually a "Top Skipped Test Titles" table.
- Operators cannot tell whether a skip was caused by missing credentials, backend release gaps, or a real regression.

Recommended fix:

- Rename the table to "Skipped Tests" unless actual reasons are captured.
- Better: introduce a small `skipWithReason(ctx, reason)` helper that logs structured skip events to a JSONL artifact, then merge that artifact into the reliability report.

### P1 - Some Tests Are Weak Or Outdated

Examples:

- `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts:143-184` says "triggers a fresh dump", but the test does not execute the program. It can pass by reading any existing dump if no new dump exists.
- `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts:148` uses persistent `ZARC1_E2E_DUMP`, but it is not declared in `PERSISTENT_OBJECTS`; a live search confirmed it exists after the run.
- `tests/integration/abapgit.integration.test.ts:95` and `:100` are permanent `it.skip()` tests with no opt-in path, issue link, or expiry.
- `tests/integration/fugr-func.integration.test.ts` and `tests/integration/fugr-func-params.integration.test.ts` call `ctx.skip()` without reason in several branches, weakening telemetry.

Recommended fix:

- Rename or rewrite the diagnostics dump test. Either truly execute the program via a supported mechanism, or split it into "prepare dump fixture" and "read existing dump detail".
- Add `ZARC1_E2E_DUMP` to persistent fixture management or delete it after the diagnostic test.
- Convert abapGit hard skips into opt-in tests gated by `TEST_ABAPGIT_REMOTE_TESTS=true` plus a STRUST/preflight check.
- Always provide a reason to `ctx.skip()`.

### P1 - E2E Local Scripts Are Not Portable On macOS

During local E2E startup:

- `scripts/e2e-start-local.sh:37-38` used Linux-style `fuser -k "${MCP_PORT}/tcp"`, which errored on macOS.
- `scripts/e2e-start-local.sh:83-84` used `grep -P`, which BSD grep does not support; health metadata printed as `unknown`.
- `scripts/e2e-stop-local.sh:44-48` searched for JSON `"level":"error"` entries, but the server log format is `[timestamp] ERROR: ...`. It reported no errors while the log contained 33 `ERROR:` lines, many from expected negative tests and fixture failures.

Recommended fix:

- Replace `grep -P` health parsing with `node -e` JSON parsing.
- Use `lsof -ti tcp:${MCP_PORT} | xargs kill` on macOS, or branch by platform.
- Update error-summary grep to match the actual logger format and optionally suppress known negative-test request IDs.

### P2 - CI Gating And Concurrency Drift

`.github/workflows/test.yml` has comments that no longer match behavior:

- `on:` only includes `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch`; no `push` trigger exists.
- The E2E comment says "Run on push (main) and internal PRs", but push is not configured.
- Top-level concurrency group is `sap-tests-${{ github.ref }}`. Different PR refs can still run SAP-heavy jobs concurrently, despite the comment saying only one SAP-hitting workflow at a time.
- `docs:` and `chore:` PRs skip the `test` job entirely. That saves SAP time, but also skips unit/lint/typecheck for dependency and test-infra chore PRs.

Recommended fix:

- Move SAP serialization to job-level concurrency for integration/E2E with a repository-global key.
- Keep unit/lint/typecheck running on docs/chore PRs, or make the skip rule path-based rather than title-based.
- Align comments with actual triggers or re-add `push` if intended.

## Finding Deep Dives And Remediation Design

This section expands each finding into root cause, failure mode, and concrete fix criteria. It is intentionally prescriptive so follow-up implementation can be split into small PRs without redoing the research.

### 1. Fixture Sync Activation Contract

Current behavior:

- `tests/e2e/setup.ts` treats `SAPActivate` `isError=true` as a warning in `activateObject()`.
- `syncPersistentFixtures()` records the object as created/recreated after `activateObject()` returns, even when activation failed.
- `tests/e2e/sync-fixtures.ts` prints `created/recreated/unchanged/deleted`, but not `skipped`, so fixture health is easy to miss in CLI output.

Root cause:

- The fixture harness conflates "activation returned warnings" with "activation failed". The MCP result shape has only `isError`, so a backend-specific warning needs classification before it is safe to ignore.
- The invalid fixture source makes this visible: `tests/fixtures/abap/zi_arc1_i33_root.ddls.abap` uses classic CDS annotations on a view entity. On this S/4 system, `@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter` is rejected for view entities. The dependent projection then fails because the root is inactive.

Why this can still produce green E2E:

- Some tests read source or parse dependency text and do not require active runtime objects.
- `cds-impact` can still validate local source relationships while the live object is inactive.
- The server log contains activation errors, but `scripts/e2e-stop-local.sh` currently misses them because it searches for JSON log fields that are not present in text logs.

Fix design:

- Fix the fixture first: remove `@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName` and `@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter` from the view-entity fixture unless a release-specific reason requires them. Keep only annotations valid for view entities on the supported S/4 target.
- Change `activateObject()` to throw on `activateResult.isError` unless the text matches a known activation warning category that is explicitly allowed.
- After sync, verify persistent fixtures through an active-state check. Acceptable options are `SAPRead(INACTIVE_OBJECTS)` absence, a successful `SAPActivate` result, or a targeted ADT active-source/read check per object type.
- Make `tests/e2e/sync-fixtures.ts` print `skipped` count and skipped labels/reasons. It should exit non-zero for unclassified activation failures.
- Add unit tests around fixture sync using a mocked `callTool()` path: activation error must not count as `created` or `recreated`; classified backend gaps must count as `skipped`.

Acceptance criteria:

- A fixture activation failure fails `npm run test:e2e:fixtures` unless it is classified.
- `npm run test:e2e:full` cannot start the test phase with inactive managed fixtures.
- The reportable fixture summary includes created, recreated, unchanged, deleted, and skipped.

### 2. CTS Transport And Transportable Package Cleanup

Current behavior:

- `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts` creates a transport in the create/get group, stores `createdTransportId`, and never deletes or releases that request.
- `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts` tracks `createdTransportIds` but `afterAll()` only logs a manual cleanup message.
- The package-enabled follow-up run proved a worse failure mode: generated transported programs can become TADIR rows attached to locked transport tasks while normal ADT read/search endpoints no longer resolve the object.

Root cause:

- Transport requests are treated as durable test evidence rather than test-owned resources.
- Object cleanup and transport cleanup are separate concerns in the tests, but in SAP CTS they are coupled. A generated object must be deleted with the correct transport while it is still addressable; only then can the task/request be deleted or released cleanly.
- The reverse-lookup integration branch assumes a class-style object URL, while the configured package currently exposes generated `PROG` entries. That makes the optional branch partly mismatched to the live package shape.

Why this matters:

- Draft transports accumulate across runs and make `listTransports` less deterministic.
- Parallel or repeated CI runs can see each other's old test transports.
- Once a task contains a locked ghost object, ARC-1 may not be able to clean it up through normal ADT endpoints. Manual SAP cleanup may be required.

Fix design:

- Introduce a transport cleanup registry that records request id, task id when available, created object type/name, package, and transport used for deletion.
- For each test-created transport, prefer this lifecycle: create request, create/update object, assert behavior, delete object with the same transport, verify no object residue, delete empty transport request.
- For tests that intentionally validate release behavior, release the transport or move them behind an explicit opt-in such as `TEST_TRANSPORT_RELEASE_TESTS=true`.
- Make `afterAll()` fail the suite when current-run transport cleanup fails. Logging only is not enough for a shared SAP system.
- Add a post-run CTS residue assertion for descriptions beginning `ARC-1 E2E` and `ARC-1 IT`, scoped to the current run timestamp or unique run id.
- Fix or parameterize the reverse-lookup object URL so `TEST_TRANSPORT_OBJECT_TYPE=PROG|CLAS|...` controls the object endpoint used by the test.

Acceptance criteria:

- A clean run leaves zero new draft `ARC-1 E2E` or `ARC-1 IT` transports.
- Package-enabled transport tests either delete their generated object and transport or fail with a clear cleanup error.
- The current stuck objects are documented for manual cleanup: `A4HK905159` / `ZARC1_TR_6N7NC0` and `A4HK905161` / `ZARC1_TR_6N9SK1`.

### 3. Pseudo-Skip Discipline

Current behavior:

- Some tests return early after a feature probe without calling `ctx.skip()`.
- Some tests print `[SKIP]` and return. Vitest records these as passed tests, not skipped tests.
- `tests/e2e/helpers.ts` still contains `skipIf()` with an outdated comment saying Vitest cannot skip inside a test.

Root cause:

- The skip policy was improved previously, but old patterns were not completely removed and there is no static guard preventing them from returning.

Why this matters:

- False passes are worse than honest skips. They inflate pass counts and hide unsupported backend behavior.
- Reliability telemetry cannot catch these because the test runner never sees a skip.

Fix design:

- Replace boolean early returns with helpers that require the Vitest context, for example `requireFeature(ctx, sktdSupported, 'SKTD not supported on this backend')`.
- Convert the activation-failure tests to `async (ctx) => { ... return ctx.skip(reason); }`.
- Delete `skipIf()` or rewrite it so it accepts `ctx` and delegates to `ctx.skip(reason)`.
- Add a static unit test or CI script that rejects `[SKIP]` log strings and bare `return;` in E2E/integration test bodies unless allowlisted with a reason.

Acceptance criteria:

- No E2E/integration test can silently pass because an unsupported feature branch returned early.
- All skip paths include an actionable reason visible in the Vitest output or the supplemental skip artifact.

### 4. Skip Telemetry Semantics

Current behavior:

- `scripts/ci/collect-test-reliability.mjs` labels skipped test titles as "Top Skip Reasons".
- Vitest JSON and the observed JUnit output do not preserve `ctx.skip()` reason messages in a way this script can currently consume.
- `scripts/ci/summarize-skips.mjs` can categorize verbose reporter output, but the main CI reliability report uses JSON artifacts instead.

Root cause:

- The reporting script assumes `assertionResults` contain reason text. In the observed artifacts, the only stable value is the test title.

Why this matters:

- Operators cannot distinguish expected S/4/BTP release gaps from fixture failures or policy problems.
- A growing skip count can look acceptable if the table labels are misleading.

Fix design:

- Short-term: rename the table to "Top Skipped Tests" unless real reasons are available.
- Better: add a structured skip artifact. A helper such as `recordSkip(ctx, reason, metadata)` can append JSONL records from `requireOrSkip()`, `expectToolSuccessOrSkip()`, and direct skip helpers.
- Make direct `ctx.skip()` rare or wrap it in a helper so reasons are consistently recorded.
- Merge the JSONL skip records into `collect-test-reliability.mjs`; fall back to titles only when no structured reason exists.
- Keep `summarize-skips.mjs` for ad hoc verbose runs, but do not treat it as the source of truth for CI unless the workflow uploads the raw verbose logs.

Acceptance criteria:

- The reliability summary distinguishes `NO_CREDENTIALS`, `NO_TRANSPORT_PACKAGE`, backend unsupported, fixture missing, and unclassified skip reasons.
- Any unclassified skip reason appears as a warning in the summary.

### 5. Weak Or Outdated Tests

Diagnostics dump test:

- The test name says it "triggers a fresh dump", but ARC-1 does not execute the created program. The test creates/updates/activates `ZARC1_E2E_DUMP`, then reads whatever matching or available dump already exists.
- If a stale `COMPUTE_INT_ZERODIVIDE` exists, the test can pass without proving the newly prepared program caused it.
- `ZARC1_E2E_DUMP` is persistent in practice but not managed by `PERSISTENT_OBJECTS`.

Recommended correction:

- Either add a real execution mechanism and assert the dump timestamp/program matches this run, or rename/split the test into "prepares dump fixture" and "reads available dump details".
- Add `ZARC1_E2E_DUMP` to managed persistent fixtures if it should stay, or create it with a unique name and delete it in `finally`.
- If no execution mechanism exists, the test should skip when no suitable dump is already present instead of implying fresh dump coverage.

abapGit hard skips:

- `tests/integration/abapgit.integration.test.ts` permanently skips stage and pull flows.
- These are high-risk integration paths because they cross SAP SSL, remote Git connectivity, and repository state.

Recommended correction:

- Convert them to opt-in tests gated by `TEST_ABAPGIT_REMOTE_TESTS=true`, a remote URL/repo fixture, and a timeout.
- Add a preflight that distinguishes missing STRUST/SSL/network configuration from product failures.
- If no maintained fixture can be provided, remove the permanent tests and track the gap in docs rather than reporting a hard skip forever.

FUGR/FUNC skip reasons:

- The FUGR integration tests use `ctx.skip()` in backend-gap branches without useful reason text.
- This should be a small cleanup: pass the classified backend error or a specific release-gap reason into each skip.

Acceptance criteria:

- Test names describe exactly what is asserted.
- Long-lived fixtures are either in fixture management or explicitly cleaned.
- No permanent `it.skip()` remains without an owner, opt-in path, and reason.

### 6. E2E Script Portability And Log Signal

Current behavior:

- `scripts/e2e-start-local.sh` uses Linux `fuser -k "${MCP_PORT}/tcp"` when `fuser` exists. On macOS this form errors.
- The same script uses `grep -P`, which BSD grep does not support.
- `scripts/e2e-stop-local.sh` searches for JSON `"level":"error"` entries, while the local server log is text formatted as `[timestamp] ERROR: ...`.

Root cause:

- The scripts were written for Linux CI but are also used locally on macOS.
- Log parsing was coupled to a JSON format that is not the active format for this run.

Why this matters:

- Startup can appear partially broken locally even when the server starts.
- Stop summaries can say no errors were found while fixture activation and expected negative-test errors are present in the log.

Fix design:

- Replace `grep -P` health parsing with `node -e` JSON parsing, which is portable because Node is already required.
- Implement a platform-aware port cleanup function: use `lsof -tiTCP:${MCP_PORT} -sTCP:LISTEN | xargs kill` on macOS and `fuser` on Linux.
- Update error summarization to detect both JSON and text logger formats.
- Categorize expected negative-test errors separately from unexpected setup/runtime errors. Fixture activation errors should be prominent, not buried among expected 4xx tests.

Acceptance criteria:

- `npm run test:e2e:full` startup prints version/start time on macOS and Linux.
- Stop summary reports text-format `ERROR:` lines and highlights fixture setup failures.

### 7. CI Gating And SAP Serialization

Current behavior:

- The workflow comments say push/main behavior exists, but `on:` currently includes only `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch`.
- Top-level concurrency uses `sap-tests-${{ github.ref }}`, which serializes reruns on the same ref but does not serialize different PR refs.
- `docs:` and `chore:` PR titles skip the whole `test` job, not only SAP-heavy jobs.

Root cause:

- The workflow evolved from "skip SAP-heavy work" into "skip all tests" for some PR titles.
- Concurrency was placed at workflow level using a ref-specific key, which does not match the stated "only one SAP-hitting workflow" goal.

Fix design:

- Keep unit/lint/typecheck/npx smoke on every PR. These are cheap and do not require SAP.
- Put repository-global concurrency only on SAP jobs: `integration` and `e2e`. Use a key such as `${{ github.repository }}-sap-live-a4h`.
- Prefer `cancel-in-progress: false` for SAP live jobs. Canceling a run while it holds locks or owns cleanup can create exactly the residue this audit found.
- Decide whether `push` to `main` should run tests. Either re-add it or update comments.
- Replace title-based skip with path-based or label-based SAP gating if the goal is saving live system capacity.

Acceptance criteria:

- Chore/test-infra PRs still run unit/lint/typecheck.
- At most one SAP live integration/E2E job uses the shared S4 system at a time across PRs.
- Workflow comments match actual triggers and scheduling behavior.

### 8. Runtime, Parallelization, And Server Capacity

Current configuration:

- `vitest.integration.config.ts` sets `fileParallelism: false` and `sequence.concurrent: false`.
- `tests/e2e/vitest.e2e.config.ts` also serializes files and tests because all E2E tests share one MCP server.
- ARC-1 itself has a request-level concurrency limit: `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT` / `--max-concurrent`, default `10`, passed into `AdtClient` and enforced by `src/adt/semaphore.ts` around SAP HTTP requests.
- HTTP mode also has Layer 1 ingress rate limiting through `ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`, default `20` per minute/IP for auth endpoints. `/mcp` receives a derived limit of `max(value * 30, 600)` requests/minute/IP, so the default `/mcp` cap is `600` per minute/IP.
- Layer 2 per-user MCP tool-call limiting is controlled by `ARC1_RATE_LIMIT`; default `0` means disabled.

Important distinction:

- Increasing `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT` lets one server issue more simultaneous SAP HTTP requests.
- Raising or disabling `ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` / `ARC1_RATE_LIMIT` changes request admission. It does not increase SAP HTTP concurrency once a tool call is admitted.
- Enabling Vitest file parallelism makes independent test files run at the same time, with overlapping object creation, locks, CSRF/session use, cleanup, and CTS mutations.
- These are not interchangeable. The server may handle more request concurrency while the SAP test data model still cannot tolerate parallel writes.

Safe parallelization model:

- Read-only shards are the first candidates: smoke reads, cache reads, CDS context/impact reads, revisions, SAPGit read/safety, and selected diagnostics reads.
- Write-heavy shards should remain sequential until each file owns unique names, transports, and cleanup verification.
- Transport tests should remain isolated. They mutate global CTS state and include the slowest individual tests.
- Each parallel E2E shard should run its own MCP server on a separate port and its own cache file/memory cache. Sharing one server mostly queues requests and makes failures cascade.

Server-capacity guidance:

- For local experiments, start with `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT=10` because that is the default already tested.
- Try `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT=15` or `20` only for read-only shards, while watching SAP "Service cannot be reached", 5xx, timeout, and enqueue errors.
- Keep `ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` and `ARC1_RATE_LIMIT` explicit in load-smoke logs. If an experiment sees `429` responses or MCP rate-limit errors, adjust or disable the relevant rate-limit layer for the experiment before treating the result as an SAP capacity failure.
- Do not raise server concurrency for write/transport suites until cleanup gates are in place. More concurrency can amplify leaked locks and partial creates.
- Add a dedicated server load smoke before broad parallelism: for example, run 20 concurrent `SAPRead SYSTEM` or safe `SAPSearch` calls through one HTTP server and assert no transport/session breakage.

Runtime reduction plan:

- Split profiles before enabling parallelism: `integration:core`, `integration:slow`, `e2e:read`, `e2e:write`, `e2e:transport`.
- Move repeated live cache warmup behavior into unit tests where possible; keep one live warmup smoke.
- Keep recursive release tests manual/nightly unless CTS code changed.
- Only after cleanup gates are green, run read-only profiles in parallel servers and measure whether wall time improves without backend instability.

Acceptance criteria:

- Read-only parallel shards produce the same pass/skip counts as serial runs.
- No new current-run `ZARC1*` residue or draft transports appear after a parallel experiment.
- Server logs show no increase in timeout, reset, 5xx, or enqueue categories.

### 9. Coverage Improvement Priorities

Current risk profile:

- Overall coverage is acceptable for general logic, but weakest where production risk is highest: HTTP auth, server startup modes, BTP destination/connectivity, XSUAA, cookie extraction, and audit sinks.
- These areas are hard to validate through live tests alone because failures depend on auth headers, token shape, proxy settings, and startup configuration.

Highest-value unit coverage additions:

- `src/server/http.ts`: API key profile matching, missing/invalid auth branches, OIDC verifier creation, XSUAA fallback behavior, MCP handler error mapping, health/CORS/security header combinations.
- `src/server/server.ts`: standard vs hyperfocused tool registration, cache mode selection, startup probe success/failure/timeout, per-user client creation with principal propagation, safety config propagation.
- `src/adt/btp.ts`: VCAP parsing, service-key parsing, destination lookup success/failure, connectivity proxy construction, token fetch failure, missing destination properties.
- `src/server/xsuaa.ts`: JWKS/key failures, audience/scope extraction variants, local scope mapping, admin/write/read implication paths.
- `src/extract-sap-cookies.ts`: CLI argument parsing, browser executable detection, CDP cookie conversion, Netscape output formatting, timeout/error paths. These can use fixtures and mocks; they do not need a live browser.
- `src/server/sinks/file.ts` and `src/server/sinks/btp-auditlog.ts`: file write failures, invalid config, token failure, audit API failure, redaction preservation.

Coverage strategy:

- Do not chase percentage alone. Target branches that encode security, auth, and deployment behavior.
- Prefer focused unit tests with mocked fetch/fs/time over new live tests for auth/proxy branches.
- Add a small number of integration smoke tests only where wire compatibility matters and credentials are available.

Acceptance criteria:

- Branch coverage improves first in `server/http`, `server/server`, `adt/btp`, and `server/xsuaa`.
- New tests assert negative paths, not just happy-path construction.
- Coverage report labels remain informational unless the project decides to add minimum thresholds later.

## Second-Pass Deep Dive Evidence

### Slowest Individual Tests

The slowest tests are concentrated enough that targeted profile splits should reduce wall time without weakening coverage.

Integration slowest:

| Runtime | Test |
|---:|---|
| 48.3s | `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts` > `releaseTransportRecursive` > `recursively releases a transport` |
| 42.4s | `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `second warmup run skips unchanged objects` |
| 23.8s | `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `TADIR query returns custom CLAS/INTF objects` |
| 22.3s | `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `warmup indexes objects into cache` |
| 21.6s | `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` > `warmup` > `warmup sets isWarmupAvailable flag` |
| 10.2s | `tests/integration/adt.integration.test.ts` > `SAPWrite batch_create activateAtEnd` > `activateAtEnd=true activates a composition-linked DDLS pair` |
| 9.3s | `tests/integration/adt.integration.test.ts` > `edit_method against class includes` > `round-trips a local handler method body` |

E2E slowest:

| Runtime | Test |
|---:|---|
| 47.1s | `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts` > `release_recursive releases transport` |
| 34.9s | `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > `create SRVB, activate, publish, unpublish, delete` |
| 29.9s | `tests/e2e/navigate.e2e.test.ts` > `finds references to BAPIRET2 structure` |
| 24.6s | `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > `create DDLS CDS view entity + BDEF` |
| 16.6s | `tests/e2e/navigate.e2e.test.ts` > `finds references to T000 table` |
| 16.1s | `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > `DCLS lifecycle` |
| 15.8s | `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > `create SRVD service definition` |
| 15.2s | `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` > `batch_create for table entity + CDS view + DCL` |
| 14.5s | `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts` > `ATC findings include quickfix metadata` |

### Live SAP Residue

Read-only live queries after the run found:

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---:|
| TADIR rows with `OBJ_NAME LIKE 'ZARC1%' OR 'ZI_ARC1%' OR 'ZTABL_ARC1%'` | 488 |
| `BDEF` rows | 13 |
| `DCLS` rows | 7 |
| `DDLS` rows | 144 |
| `DOMA` rows | 102 |
| `DTEL` rows | 74 |
| `FUGR` rows | 7 |
| `MSAG` rows | 31 |
| `PROG` rows | 40 |
| `STOB` rows | 42 |

Targeted current-run transient checks:

- `OBJ_NAME LIKE '%MP15%'`: 0 rows.
- `OBJ_NAME LIKE '%INLG%'`: 0 ARC-1 rows; only SAP standard `RSTSLINLG`.
- `ZARC1SKTDMP15%`: 0 rows.
- `ZARC1_DOMA_MP15%`, `ZARC1_DMD_MP15%`, `ZARC1_DEL_MP15%`: 0 rows.

This supports that current-run E2E transient cleanup mostly worked. Old residue remains substantial:

- `ZARC1_E2E_ACTBROKE_%`: 2 old rows.
- `ZARC1_E2E_WPOL%`: 16 old rows.
- Many old generated DDIC/RAP rows from previous runs are still present.

E2E server-log reconciliation:

- Successful `SAPWrite create` calls in the current E2E run: 40.
- Successful `SAPWrite delete` calls in the current E2E run: 45.
- Successful creates not followed by a later successful delete: only `ZTABL_ARC1_I33`, `ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT`, and `ZI_ARC1_I33_PROJ`, which are managed persistent fixtures.
- The problem is that `ZI_ARC1_I33_ROOT` and `ZI_ARC1_I33_PROJ` are persistent but inactive.

Transport residue:

- `listTransports()` after the full run showed 17 `ARC-1` transport requests in draft/released status for this user.
- The current E2E run created `A4HK905131` and did not delete/release it.
- The current integration run created `A4HK905123` and intentionally did not auto-release it.
- The follow-up package-enabled integration run temporarily raised the count to 21; best-effort cleanup deleted the two empty transports and left 19, with `A4HK905159` and `A4HK905161` stuck due locked ghost objects.

### Static Skip/Catch Inventory

Hard skips:

- `tests/integration/abapgit.integration.test.ts:95`
- `tests/integration/abapgit.integration.test.ts:100`

Pseudo-skips:

- `tests/e2e/sktd-write.e2e.test.ts:58`, `:76`, `:87`, `:98`
- `tests/e2e/activation-failure.e2e.test.ts:70-71`, `:89-90`
- `tests/e2e/helpers.ts:205-210` contains an unused/outdated `skipIf()` helper that encourages pseudo-skip behavior.

Skip calls without useful reason text:

- `tests/integration/fugr-func.integration.test.ts`: multiple `ctx.skip()` calls in known backend-gap branches.
- `tests/integration/fugr-func-params.integration.test.ts`: multiple `ctx.skip()` calls in lock/backend-gap branches.

Broad catches that should stay under observation:

- `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts`: create/update/activate steps continue after catch; acceptable for broad diagnostic smoke, weak for a test named "triggers a fresh dump".
- `tests/integration/adt.integration.test.ts`: several `best-effort-cleanup` catches explicitly accept leaving transient `$TMP` objects to time out. These are now visible in the live residue count and should be tightened over time.

## Detailed Integration File Review

| File | Detailed assessment |
|---|---|
| `tests/integration/adt.integration.test.ts` | Very broad live ADT coverage and still valuable. It also hides the most complexity: batch create, edit-method, DDLX/SRVB, diagnostics, safety, DDIC reads, search variants. Weak spots are best-effort cleanup comments that allow `$TMP` leftovers and two runtime skips. Split into smaller files before parallelization. |
| `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` | Coverage is meaningful, but it is the largest integration runtime. Multiple live `runWarmup()` calls repeat expensive TADIR scans. Move most warmup behavior to unit tests or a slow profile; keep one live warmup smoke. |
| `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts` | Valuable for CTS compatibility but actively creates transport requests. `createTransport` intentionally does not auto-release; recursive release is slow. With `TEST_TRANSPORT_PACKAGE=Z_LLM_TEST_PACKAGE`, the auto-corrNr tests pass but leave ghost `ZARC1_TR_*` TADIR rows and undeletable locked CTS tasks. Needs cleanup policy before any more frequent CI use. |
| `tests/integration/crud.lifecycle.integration.test.ts` | Good registry-based lifecycle coverage. Cleanup helper is better than most live tests, though it still uses best-effort retries. |
| `tests/integration/context.integration.test.ts` | Good context/compression coverage. Discovery fallbacks are reasonable. No current skip issue found. |
| `tests/integration/fugr-func.integration.test.ts` | Good live FUGR/FUNC coverage. Replace bare `ctx.skip()` with reasoned skips. |
| `tests/integration/fugr-func-params.integration.test.ts` | Good structured parameter lifecycle coverage. Replace bare `ctx.skip()` with reasoned skips. |
| `tests/integration/abapgit.integration.test.ts` | The two hard skips are stale. Convert to opt-in with remote/STRUST preflight, or remove if no longer actionable. |
| `tests/integration/gcts.integration.test.ts` | Good read-only gCTS coverage. Some systems may return empty payloads; assertions still validate shape. |
| `tests/integration/audit-logging.integration.test.ts` | Good integration signal for audit events. No major issue found. |
| `tests/integration/elicitation.integration.test.ts` | Mostly unit-like but valuable because it covers elicitation flow/audit behavior. No skip/cleanup issue found. |
| `tests/integration/btp-abap.integration.test.ts` | Correctly skipped in S4-only runs. Needs separate periodic BTP run to avoid permanent blind spot. |
| `tests/integration/btp-abap.smoke.integration.test.ts` | Same as above; useful when BTP credentials are supplied. |

## Detailed E2E File Review

| File | Detailed assessment |
|---|---|
| `tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts` | Highest E2E runtime. Current-run object cleanup looked good, but helper deletes swallow all errors. Keep sequential. Consider splitting package/TABL/DDLS/BDEF/SRVD/SRVB/DCLS/MSAG into profile shards. |
| `tests/e2e/navigate.e2e.test.ts` | Expensive because of broad where-used calls against standard objects. Skips are real. Consider marking BAPIRET2/T000 reference scans as slow profile or lowering scope when not testing navigation changes. |
| `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts` | Main E2E cleanup offender. The create+get test creates a draft transport and keeps it for later get/list assertions but never deletes/releases it. Add afterAll cleanup for `createdTransportId`. |
| `tests/e2e/ddic-write.e2e.test.ts` | Current-run DDIC transient cleanup looked good. `skipOnBatchCreateFailure()` returns after a real `ctx.skip()` and is acceptable. |
| `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts` | Broad diagnostic smoke coverage. The "triggers a fresh dump" name is inaccurate because it cannot execute the program and can validate any existing dump. `ZARC1_E2E_DUMP` should be managed or deleted. |
| `tests/e2e/func-write.e2e.test.ts` | Current-run cleanup looked good. Uses best-effort helper, but no live residue with current-run names. |
| `tests/e2e/func-params.e2e.test.ts` | Current-run cleanup looked good. Useful issue-specific lifecycle test. |
| `tests/e2e/sktd-write.e2e.test.ts` | Current-run cleanup looked good. Pseudo-skips remain if SKTD is not supported. |
| `tests/e2e/activation-failure.e2e.test.ts` | Valuable regression. Current-run object was deleted. Pseudo-skips and "leaving stale objects is acceptable in CI" comment should be fixed. Old `ZARC1_E2E_ACTBROKE_*` rows prove this has leaked before. |
| `tests/e2e/smoke.e2e.test.ts` | Good broad smoke. Some backend-specific skips are real. Current-run generated write-policy object was deleted. |
| `tests/e2e/cache.e2e.test.ts` | Good E2E cache behavior and cheap enough. No major issue. |
| `tests/e2e/cds-context.e2e.test.ts` | Uses system demo DDLS discovery; reasonable. The beforeAll `[SKIP]` log is harmless because individual tests use `requireOrSkip()`. |
| `tests/e2e/cds-impact.e2e.test.ts` | Useful, but currently coupled to inactive persistent fixtures. It can pass via source parsing even when fixtures are inactive. Add fixture active-state precondition. |
| `tests/e2e/rap.e2e.test.ts` | Good RAP read/write smoke. Pre-cleanup of stale `ZARC1_E2E_WRITE` is useful. |
| `tests/e2e/revisions.e2e.test.ts` | Good revision coverage. Skip helper is explicit and reasoned. |
| `tests/e2e/sap-git.e2e.test.ts` | Good read/safety coverage. Early `beforeAll` return is not a pseudo-skip because each test calls `requireOrSkip()`. |
| `tests/e2e/setup.ts` | Must be hardened. Activation errors should not be warnings unless classified. |
| `tests/e2e/sync-fixtures.ts` | Does not print `summary.skipped`, so skipped fixtures can be hidden in CLI output. |
| `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` | Useful zombie preflight. Contains Unicode console art only; no behavioral issue. |
| `tests/e2e/helpers.ts` | `skipIf()` is outdated; `expectToolSuccessOrSkip()` and `skipOnBatchCreateFailure()` are useful. |

## Runtime Improvement Plan

Do not broadly enable parallelism for all integration/E2E tests yet. Current configs serialize files because tests share one SAP user, one server, locks, CSRF/session state, transports, and mutable ABAP objects. The observed failures and cleanup residue support keeping write-heavy tests sequential until isolation improves.

Recommended phased plan:

1. Split slow/optional profiles before parallelizing:
   - `test:integration:core`: current integration minus repeated cache warmup and recursive transport release.
   - `test:integration:slow`: cache warmup, recursive release, optional transportable-package tests.
   - `test:e2e:read`: smoke, cache, CDS context/impact, RAP read, revisions, SAPGit read/safety.
   - `test:e2e:write`: RAP write, DDIC write, FUNC write, SKTD write, activation failure.
   - `test:e2e:transport`: transport suite only.
2. Reduce `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts` runtime:
   - Avoid repeating full `$TMP` warmups in one file.
   - Share one prewarmed cache per suite where possible.
   - Move delta/full warmup behavior into a slow profile or mock most warmup logic at unit level.
3. Keep transport release tests sequential and optional:
   - `releaseTransportRecursive` took about 46-48s in both integration/E2E.
   - Make it opt-in on PRs or run nightly/manual unless it is the feature under change.
4. Parallelize only read-only shards after isolation:
   - Run separate MCP servers on separate ports, each with its own memory cache.
   - Keep the server request limit explicit per shard with `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT`; default is 10. Raise it only for read-only experiments after a load smoke passes.
   - Keep write-heavy suites single-file sequential.
   - Add a server concurrency smoke test before assuming the HTTP transport can handle the load safely.
5. Add cleanup gates before adding parallelism:
   - No new draft `ARC-1` transports after a run.
   - No inactive `ZARC1*` / `ZI_ARC1*` objects except explicitly allowlisted fixtures.
   - No transient `ZARC1*` objects from current-run prefixes left behind.

## Setup And Destroy Review

Current strengths:

- Most transient E2E write tests use unique names and `finally` cleanup.
- CRUD lifecycle tests use a registry and cleanup helper.
- E2E startup/stopping works despite macOS portability warnings.

Current gaps:

- Persistent fixture activation failures are not fatal.
- Transport requests are intentionally/manual-cleanup in integration and partially untracked in E2E.
- Diagnostic dump program is persistent but unmanaged.
- Live system contains many old `ZARC1*` objects. The audit search was capped at 200 results and still hit the cap.
- Live inactive-object check found 15 inactive ARC-1-looking objects, including the current invalid CDS fixture pair.

Recommended cleanup hardening:

- Add `npm run test:e2e:audit-cleanup` or equivalent that reports:
  - created transport requests by description prefix and status,
  - inactive ARC-1 objects,
  - transient-name patterns older than the current run,
  - persistent fixture active/readable status.
- Make cleanup failures fail the suite for tests that create objects in the current run.
- Keep a small allowlist for intentionally persistent fixtures only.

## Per-File Review

### Unit Files

All unit files passed with no skips. The main issue is not correctness drift; it is coverage concentration. The table below is an inventory checkpoint for resuming this audit.

### Integration And E2E Files

The integration and E2E per-file reviews are embedded in the Test Runs section because these suites are where skip/runtime/cleanup behavior matters most. The highest priority files to fix first are:

1. `tests/e2e/setup.ts` and CDS fixture files.
2. `tests/e2e/saptransport.e2e.test.ts`.
3. `tests/integration/transport.integration.test.ts`.
4. `tests/e2e/sktd-write.e2e.test.ts`.
5. `tests/e2e/activation-failure.e2e.test.ts`.
6. `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts`.
7. `scripts/ci/collect-test-reliability.mjs`.
8. `scripts/e2e-start-local.sh` and `scripts/e2e-stop-local.sh`.

## Recommended Work Items

Recommended execution order: fix measurement first, then correctness, then runtime. Do not start by raising `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT` or enabling broad Vitest file parallelism. The current suite still has false-green paths and cleanup leaks; making those paths faster would increase SAP-system pressure without improving trust in the result.

### Quick Wins

These are low-risk PRs that improve observability or local usability without changing the live SAP test contract.

| Order | Item | Evaluation | Expected impact | Verification |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rename reliability summary `Top Skip Reasons` to `Top Skipped Tests`. | The current script reports skipped test titles, not structured reasons. The label is misleading but the change is tiny. | Removes a known telemetry ambiguity immediately. | `npm test -- tests/unit/scripts/collect-test-reliability.test.ts` |
| 2 | Fix macOS portability in `scripts/e2e-start-local.sh` and `scripts/e2e-stop-local.sh`. | `fuser -k`, `grep -oP`, and JSON-only error matching do not match common local developer environments or the default text logger. | Makes local E2E reruns easier and makes server-error summaries trustworthy. | Run start/stop scripts locally; unit-test any parsing extracted into JS. |
| 3 | Align CI comments/triggers and gate behavior. | The workflow comments and behavior disagree in places, and docs/chore PRs currently skip unit/lint/typecheck through the `gate` dependency. | Avoids silent loss of cheap CI signal on non-SAP changes. | Open a docs-only test PR or inspect `gate` output in `workflow_dispatch`. |

### Quick Wins Implementation Update (2026-05-27)

All three quick wins above were implemented in this PR after rebasing onto `origin/main` `7532503d`:

- Reliability summary wording now says `Top Skipped Tests`. The script still counts skipped test titles, not structured skip reasons; structured skip artifacts remain a later improvement.
- Local E2E scripts now avoid GNU-only `grep -P`, prefer `lsof` before Linux `fuser` for port cleanup, and use `scripts/e2e-local-utils.mjs` for health JSON parsing and log error summarization.
- The GitHub Actions `test` job no longer depends on the SAP title gate, so npm audit, lint, typecheck, package smoke, unit tests, and coverage run on all PRs. The `gate` job now controls only SAP-heavy `integration` and `e2e` jobs. SAP-heavy jobs use repository-wide concurrency group `${{ github.repository }}-sap-live-a4h` with `cancel-in-progress: false`.

Local validation after implementation:

- `npm test -- tests/unit/scripts/collect-test-reliability.test.ts tests/unit/scripts/e2e-local-utils.test.ts tests/unit/workflows/test-workflow.test.ts`: 20 tests passed.
- `bash -n scripts/e2e-start-local.sh && bash -n scripts/e2e-stop-local.sh`: passed.
- `node scripts/e2e-local-utils.mjs` smoke checks: health parsing and text/JSON error summary worked.
- `npm test`: 91 files / 3004 tests passed after refreshing dependencies with `npm ci`. Local `npm ci` emitted engine warnings because the local runtime was Node `22.18.0` while current dependencies request newer Node 22 patch levels; CI Node `22` and `24` both passed.
- `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:npx-smoke`, and `npm run btp:validate`: passed.

GitHub Actions validation:

- Run `26534513455` (`ci: implement test audit quick wins`) passed: `gate`, `mta-validate`, `test (22)`, `test (24)`, `integration`, `e2e`, and `reliability-summary` all succeeded.
- The title gate worked as intended after the PR title changed from `chore:` to `ci:`: `gate` passed, both Node matrix `test` jobs ran and passed, then `integration` and `e2e` ran.
- `integration` passed in `6m58s` with `199 passed / 41 skipped / 240 total`.
- `e2e` passed in `14m59s` with `134 passed / 3 skipped / 137 total`.
- The E2E local start script printed parsed health metadata (`Version: 0.9.6`, `Started: 2026-05-27T19:51:25.499Z`), proving the Node health parser replaced the prior `grep -P` path correctly.
- The E2E stop script reported `/tmp/arc1-e2e-logs/mcp-server.log (737 lines)` and `31 error(s)` with the last five text-format `ERROR:` log entries, proving the default text logger is now detected. The listed errors came from expected negative-path E2E assertions and did not fail the job.

New observation from the validation run:

- The E2E job passed but consumed the full `15` minute job budget (`14m59s`). Runtime reduction remains urgent before adding more E2E coverage or relying on this lane under normal CI variability.

Additional PR-readiness finding:

- A later final-check run (`26536051732`) exposed a brittle live-SAP assumption in `tests/integration/cache.integration.test.ts`: the "second warmup run skips unchanged objects" test used `$TMP`, and `$TMP` changed from `204` to `205` objects between the two warmup passes. The second pass correctly fetched the new object, but the test expected `0` fetched objects and failed.
- This PR now moves that delta-by-hash assertion to the stable S/4 demo package `$DEMO_SOI_DRAFT`, which is already the package used by the cache reverse-dependency tests. That preserves the hash-skip contract while avoiding transient `$TMP` churn and reduces this specific check from a roughly `205` object scan to the `9` object demo package on the S4 test system.

### Correctness Blockers

These should be fixed before runtime optimization because they determine whether green integration/E2E runs are meaningful.

| Order | Item | Evaluation | Expected impact | Verification |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | Fix E2E fixture activation handling and the invalid DDLS fixture. | This is the highest-risk finding: fixture activation can warn and continue, so tests can pass against stale or inactive fixtures. | Converts false-green fixture setup into a hard failure and restores trust in E2E preconditions. | `npm run test:e2e`; add active-state assertion after fixture sync. |
| 5 | Stop transport leakage in E2E and integration transport tests. | Created CTS objects are currently documented or logged, not reliably cleaned. This pollutes the shared S4 system and can affect later runs. | Reduces live-system residue and makes repeated transport runs safer. | Run focused transport tests twice; confirm no new unreleased `ZARC1_*` leftovers through CTS/TADIR checks. |
| 6 | Convert pseudo-skips to real `ctx.skip(reason)` calls. | Bare `return` and `[SKIP]` logs are counted as passes, hiding unsupported or missing-precondition paths. | Makes skip counts honest and keeps reliability summaries useful. | `npm run test:e2e`; JSON reporter shows skipped tests instead of passed pseudo-skips. |
| 7 | Clean up or explicitly declare `ZARC1_E2E_DUMP`. | The dump fixture behavior needs a clear ownership model: either clean it or document it as intentionally persistent. | Removes ambiguity between expected diagnostic residue and cleanup failure. | E2E diagnostics run plus live object search. |

### Runtime Reduction

Do this after correctness blockers. These changes should target the measured hotspots from GitHub Actions run `25674270461`, not broad parallelism first.

| Order | Item | Evaluation | Expected impact | Verification |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | Bound or share integration cache warmup. | Repeated warmup is useful coverage but expensive when repeated across live SAP tests. | Shortens integration setup without reducing endpoint coverage. | Compare integration job wall time and per-file timing before/after. |
| 9 | Move recursive transport release coverage to a slow/manual profile. | Recursive release is one of the clearest live-SAP runtime hotspots and is not needed on every PR path. | Reduces default integration/E2E wall time while preserving coverage in an explicit profile. | Default PR run excludes recursive release; slow profile still executes it. |
| 10 | Reduce broad E2E where-used queries such as repeated `BAPIRET2` checks. | Broad where-used is high latency and repeated coverage has diminishing value. | Cuts E2E runtime with low behavioral risk. | Keep one representative where-used E2E; move variants to unit/integration fixtures if needed. |
| 11 | Use `SAPManage features` instead of repeated E2E `SAPManage probe` calls where possible. | Repeated probe calls spend live runtime rediscovering capabilities that can be obtained once. | Reduces repeated setup/tool overhead. | E2E server log shows fewer probe calls with equivalent assertions. |
| 12 | Consolidate RAP write E2E coverage. | RAP write coverage is valuable, but overlapping full-path tests make the PR path slower than necessary. | Keeps one full lifecycle path while moving edge cases to narrower tests. | E2E behavior matrix still covers create/update/activate/error paths. |

### Parallelism And Coverage

Treat this as the final phase. Parallelism is useful only after the suite has reliable setup, cleanup, and skip accounting.

| Order | Item | Evaluation | Expected impact | Verification |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Split slow integration/E2E profiles before enabling broad parallelism. | Some tests share live SAP objects and transports, so file-level parallelism needs isolated profiles and fixture ownership first. | Lets PRs run the stable default path while preserving heavier coverage on demand. | Separate default and slow commands; both publish reliability artifacts. |
| 14 | Add a read-only server concurrency smoke before increasing parallel test execution. | The server default `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT=10` is capacity, not proof that SAP-facing tests are independent; current main also has HTTP/MCP rate-limit layers that must be recorded during load tests. | Provides evidence that the server and S4 test system tolerate concurrent read traffic. | Concurrent read-only smoke passes without 429/5xx/session bleed, with `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT`, `ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`, and `ARC1_RATE_LIMIT` logged. |
| 15 | Add focused unit coverage for `src/server/http.ts`, `src/server/server.ts`, `src/adt/btp.ts`, `src/server/xsuaa.ts`, and `src/extract-sap-cookies.ts`. | These areas are high-value coverage gaps because they guard auth, transport, BTP connectivity, and credential extraction. | Improves coverage where regressions are expensive and hard to diagnose through live tests. | Coverage report shows targeted line/branch gains for those files. |

## Research Completeness

At this point the requested audit areas have been covered against the S4 test system:

- Full unit, integration, coverage, and E2E runs were executed.
- A package-enabled focused transport run was executed to close the main env-gated transport-package gap.
- Static skip/pseudo-skip/catch patterns were scanned.
- Live SAP cleanup state was checked through ADT search, TADIR SQL, inactive object listing, and CTS transport listing.
- E2E current-run create/delete behavior was reconciled from the server log.
- CI workflow gating/concurrency and local E2E scripts were inspected.
- A deeper remediation design was added for each finding, including acceptance criteria, cleanup gates, skip telemetry design, and server concurrency guidance around `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT`.
- GitHub Actions run `25674270461` was inspected through run metadata and downloaded artifacts. The report now includes CI job timing, integration/E2E per-file and per-test runtime breakdowns, server-log tool timing, and runtime reduction estimates.

### Post-Rebase Review (2026-05-27)

The branch was rebased cleanly onto `origin/main` `7532503d` (`v0.9.6`). The PR diff remains docs-only. The audited test, fixture, CI, and local E2E script files were rechecked against current `main`; none of the core skip, cleanup, fixture activation, or CI-gating findings were fixed by the mainline changes.

Relevant current-main changes:

- `19942984` (`feat: layered rate limiting`) changes the server-capacity surface by adding Layer 1 `ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` and Layer 2 `ARC1_RATE_LIMIT`, while keeping `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT` as the SAP HTTP concurrency ceiling. The runtime/parallelism recommendations were updated to require logging these rate-limit settings during concurrency experiments.
- `039d8007` (`fix: route TABL/DS create to /ddic/structures`) and `b0981400` (`fix: refuse TABL/DT writes on NW 7.50/7.51 with SE11 hint`) do not resolve the invalid CDS fixture annotation, the E2E activation warning contract, pseudo-skips, or CTS cleanup leakage.
- Dependency/action bump commits do not change the audited `test.yml` gate behavior: `docs:`/`chore:` PRs still bypass the `test` job through `needs: gate`, so unit/lint/typecheck remain skipped on those title-gated PRs.

Known remaining blind spots are intentional external-scope items, not unresearched gaps in the S4 audit:

- BTP ABAP tests were not run because this audit used the S4 test system and no BTP service key was configured in this run.
- The transport reverse-lookup test for a transportable class still lacks a real configured class object in `Z_LLM_TEST_PACKAGE`; the package currently exposes only PROG entries in the live checks.
- No automated cleanup of older historical SAP residue was performed. Only a best-effort cleanup attempt was made for artifacts created by the focused follow-up run, and that attempt proved the locked-ghost failure mode.
- Supply-chain and security workflows such as Dependabot, Dependency Review, CodeQL, Docker image scanning, Trivy, and release-image gates were not part of this test-suite runtime/reliability audit.
