/**
 * Layer 2 — Per-user MCP tool-call rate limiter.
 *
 * Applied at the top of `handleToolCall` in `src/handlers/intent.ts`. Returns an MCP
 * tool error (NOT HTTP 429) on denial so the LLM client surfaces it as a tool failure
 * and the agent loop backs off correctly. Per-user token bucket keyed on the resolved
 * user identity (userName / clientId / __anon__).
 *
 * Design choices:
 * - Per-instance, in-memory only. Multi-instance attackers cost `limit × instances` —
 *   acceptable trade-off, matches stateless-DCR philosophy from PR #212.
 * - Stdio mode is exempt because there's no authInfo to key on; the caller is
 *   responsible for skipping the consume in that case.
 * - When `perMinute === 0`, the factory returns a stub whose `consume` resolves
 *   immediately with `{ allowed: true }` — no allocation, no per-key bookkeeping.
 *   This is the clean opt-out for single-user deployments.
 * - Cost weighting per tool is intentionally deferred to v2 — every consume call is
 *   one point. See ADR-0004 for the rationale.

/**
 * Resolve the per-user rate-limit key from an `AuthInfo`, walking the most-
 * specific identity claims first so distinct users never share a quota when
 * they share an auth client / application.
 *
 * Order, by descending specificity:
 *   1. `extra.userName`        — XSUAA logon name (`securityContext.getLogonName()`)
 *   2. `extra.email`           — XSUAA / OIDC email when populated
 *   3. `extra.sub`             — OIDC subject claim (guaranteed unique per user within issuer)
 *   4. `extra.preferred_username` — sometimes set on OIDC tokens
 *   5. `clientId`              — last resort. Note for OIDC this is `azp`
 *      (the app's client id), shared by all users of that app — so falling here
 *      collapses them into one bucket. The earlier checks exist specifically
 *      to avoid that. Acceptable only for the API-key path where the clientId
 *      is `api-key:<profile>` and the operator has chosen the profile granularity.
 *   6. `'__anon__'`            — token with no usable identity claim. Single
 *      shared bucket for anonymous traffic. Operators should configure auth so
 *      this branch is never reached in production.
 *
 * Why not just `sub`? Because XSUAA tokens don't put `sub` on `extra`; they put
 * the SAP logon name on `extra.userName`. OIDC does the inverse. We accept both
 * shapes rather than forcing every auth provider to align on one claim.
