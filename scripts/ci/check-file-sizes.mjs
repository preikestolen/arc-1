/**
 * File-size ratchet — a regrowth brake for the handler refactor
 * (docs/plans/completed/2026-06-11-architecture-consolidation-plan.md).
 *
 * The codebase doubled in 8 weeks and the growth concentrated in a few monoliths (intent.ts,
 * intent.test.ts). This guard fails CI when a tracked source/test file crosses its line budget,
 * so the next big file can't sneak in unnoticed. To fix a failure: split the file, or — if the
 * size is genuinely justified — consciously raise its budget in BUDGETS below (a reviewed act,
 * visible in the diff). As the refactor shrinks the seeded files, LOWER their budgets here in the
 * same commit that shrinks them.
 *
 * Run: npm run check:sizes   (also wired into .github/workflows/test.yml)

/**
 * Explicit per-file budgets. Seeded at "current size + headroom" for files that are legitimately
 * large today, so the ratchet blocks GROWTH without forcing an immediate split. Lower these as
 * the refactor lands. There is intentionally no blanket exemption for `fixtures/` directories —
 * golden data is non-.ts/.mjs and never enters the scan, and a generated CODE fixture must earn
 * an explicit budget here like everything else (a silent infinite budget is the exact regrowth
 * hole this script exists to close).
