## Project Overview

sapcli is a **Python 3 command-line interface** for SAP ABAP development, primarily targeting the ADT REST API. Created in 2018 by Jakub Filak, it's one of the oldest open-source ADT clients and focuses on **CI/CD automation**: running unit tests, ATC checks, managing transports, deploying via abapGit, and round-tripping ABAP objects to/from filesystem in abapGit format.

Not an MCP server — it's a traditional CLI tool with argparse-based subcommands. Designed for scripting and pipeline use, not LLM integration. However, it has the **deepest ADT API coverage** of any non-SAP open-source project and several mature patterns worth studying.

**Key design patterns:**

1. **ADTObject base class**: All ABAP types inherit from `ADTObject`. Each declares `OBJTYPE` as `ADTObjectType(code, basepath, xmlns, mimetype, ...)`. CRUD is uniform across all types.

2. **XML-to-Object mapper**: Custom annotation system via Python metaclasses (`OrderedClassMembers`) and decorators (`@xml_attribute`, `@xml_element`). Preserves XML element order during round-trip serialization. Most sophisticated XML→Python mapping in any open-source ADT client.

3. **CommandGroup pattern**: Each CLI module defines a `CommandGroup` subclass. Commands registered via `@CommandGroup.command()` + `@CommandGroup.argument()` decorators. Four connection types: ADT, REST, RFC, OData.

4. **Connection abstraction**: Separate connection classes per protocol — ADT (HTTP+CSRF), REST (gCTS), OData (BSP/FLP), RFC (PyRFC). Each has its own auth and session management.

## Safety/Security

**No safety system.** No read-only mode, no operation filtering, no package restrictions, no SQL blocking. All commands always available. Designed as a developer/CI tool, not a managed service.

## Transport (Protocol)

Not applicable — sapcli is a CLI tool, not an MCP server. No stdio/HTTP/SSE transport. Communicates directly with SAP via HTTP.

## Testing

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Framework | Python `unittest` (not pytest) |
| Test files | ~90 files in `test/unit/` |
| Coverage | Tracked via codecov |
| Mock infra | Custom `Connection` mock in `test/unit/mock.py` — records HTTP requests, returns pre-configured responses |
| Fixtures | XML fixtures in `test/unit/fixtures_*.py` (one per module) |
| System tests | `test/system/` — shell scripts for live SAP integration |
| CI | GitHub Actions with codecov |
| Pattern | Each `sap/adt/foo.py` → `test/unit/test_sap_adt_foo.py` |

## Dependencies

**Runtime (minimal):**
- `requests >= 2.20.0` — HTTP client
- `pyodata >= 1.7.0` — OData client
- `PyYAML >= 6.0.1` — Config files
- `PyRFC` — Optional RFC connectivity

**Dev:** pytest, coverage, pylint, flake8, mypy

Notable: uses Python's built-in `xml.sax` + `xml.etree.ElementTree` for XML — no third-party XML library. Intentionally minimal dependency footprint.

## Features This Project Has That ARC-1 Lacks

| Feature | Priority | Effort | Status (2026-04-12) |
|---------|----------|--------|---------------------|

## Applicable Improvements for ARC-1

### High Priority — Direct improvements

1. **ADT Service Discovery / MIME Version Negotiation** (`sap/adt/discovery.py`)
   - sapcli calls `GET /sap/bc/adt/discovery` at startup to learn which MIME type versions the system supports
   - This would **directly solve ARC-1's P0 415/406 content-type auto-retry issue** — instead of guessing and retrying, probe once and cache
   - **Files to modify**: `src/adt/http.ts`, `src/adt/features.ts`
   - **Pattern**: Fetch discovery doc → parse accepted MIME types per endpoint → cache → use correct Content-Type headers

2. **ABAP Unit Test Coverage** (`sap/adt/aunit.py`)
   - sapcli fetches coverage via `POST /sap/bc/adt/runtime/traces/coverage/measurements/{id}` with paginated `rel=next` follow-up
   - Statement-level coverage granularity
   - **Files to modify**: `src/adt/devtools.ts`, `src/handlers/intent.ts`

3. **ATC Output Formats** (`sap/cli/atc.py`)
   - JUnit4, sonar, checkstyle, codeclimate formatters for ATC results
   - Useful for CI/CD integration and structured error reporting to LLMs
   - **Files to modify**: `src/adt/devtools.ts` or new formatter module

### Medium Priority — Feature adoption

4. **Where-Used Scope Configuration** (`sap/adt/whereused.py`)
   - Two-step: `get_scope()` fetches default scope config from ADT, then `get_where_used()` with per-object-type filtering
   - ARC-1's where-used may be simpler — verify scope handling matches
   - **Files to check**: `src/adt/codeintel.ts`

5. ~~**Service Binding Publish** (`sap/cli/rap.py`)~~
   - ✅ Already implemented in ARC-1 via `SAPManage(action="publish_srvb"/"unpublish_srvb")`
   - Keep compatibility tests for publish/unpublish endpoint variants across releases
   - **Files to watch**: `src/adt/devtools.ts`, `src/handlers/intent.ts`

6. **Inactive Objects List** (`sap/adt/activation.py`)
   - `GET /sap/bc/adt/inactivectsobjects` — shows what needs activation
   - Useful for LLMs to understand activation state before/after writes
   - **Files to modify**: `src/adt/client.ts`, `src/handlers/intent.ts`

7. **Transport Contents / Detail Levels** (`sap/adt/cts.py`)
   - Recursive transport query shows objects in each task (E071 objects list)
   - **Files to modify**: `src/adt/transport.ts`

8. **Class Include Write Granularity** (`sap/adt/oo.py`)
   - sapcli supports writing to specific class includes: `locals_def`, `locals_imp`, `test_classes`, `macros`
   - Each has its own source URL: `/source/main`, `/includes/definitions`, `/includes/implementations`, `/includes/testclasses`
   - **Files to check**: `src/adt/crud.ts` — verify ARC-1's write handles these include types

### Low Priority — Nice-to-have / Future

9. **Execute ABAP (IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN)** — Also in dassian-adt and vibing-steampunk. Needs safety gate design.

10. **abapGit Checkout/Checkin Format** — Filesystem round-trip enables Git workflows. Could be useful for batch export/import.

11. **gCTS Integration** — Full lifecycle management. Lower priority since abapGit is more common.

12. **Function Module Auto-Group-Resolution** — UX improvement: search for FM name → resolve parent FUGR → fetch.

### Testing Insights

13. **XML Fixture Pattern** — sapcli's approach of separate `fixtures_*.py` files per module is similar to ARC-1's `tests/fixtures/xml/` but more systematic. Every ADT response has a corresponding fixture.

14. **Connection Mock** — sapcli's `test/unit/mock.py` records all HTTP requests and returns pre-configured responses. Similar to ARC-1's `mock-fetch.ts` but more structured (Request/Response named tuples with helper methods).

15. **System Tests** — `test/system/` contains shell scripts for live SAP integration testing. ARC-1 could adopt a similar approach for smoke tests.

### Documentation Insights

16. **Per-Command Documentation** — sapcli has `doc/commands/*.md` with one file per command group (28 files). ARC-1 could benefit from per-tool documentation beyond the CLAUDE.md reference.

17. **AGENTS.md** — sapcli has an AGENTS.md for AI assistants. Pattern already adopted by ARC-1.

### Error Handling Insights

18. **Typed Error Hierarchy** — sapcli's `ADTError` parses SAP XML exception format and maps `type` IDs to specific Python exceptions (`ExceptionResourceAlreadyExists`, `ExceptionResourceNotFound`, etc.). ARC-1's `AdtApiError` could benefit from similar classification for better LLM hints.

19. **Connection Error Friendliness** — `ADTConnectionError` provides human-friendly messages for Errno 5/111 (connection refused). ARC-1's `AdtNetworkError` could add similar hint text.

Closes the "MSAG read-only" note above. | Done |
| 2026-05-11 | BDEF enrichments — `2e1c979` `listinterfaces`, `2337844` behavior **extensions** create, `6162daf`/`dfa0051` `adtcore:adtTemplate` support | **Med** | **GAP ×3**: ARC-1 has base BDEF create/update but (a) no list-interfaces reader, (b) no behavior-**extension** create (AFF schema's `extendedBehaviorDefintion` is declared but unused — `aff/schemas/bdef-v1.json:45`), (c) no `adtTemplate` on create. Extension-create is the meaningful one (projection extensibility); lands in `write/rap.ts` + `write-helpers.ts`. | ✅ **DONE (extension create) — PR #507**: `SAPWrite create type=BDEF` with `extend behavior for X` source emits `adtcore:adtTemplate(base_bdef)` before packageRef; live-verified 758 + 816. (list-interfaces reader + adtTemplate-on-*definition* create still not done — low value.) |
| 2026-05-09 | auth_plugin protocol — `8eddf92`/`7ba853c` external-command auth plugin, `939e54c` response cache + `5f179f3` opt-out, `bbee6df` extend to gCTS/OData, `22d359a` **OAuth 2.0 for BTP/Steampunk**, pluginable token store | No | sapcli catching up to what ARC-1 already has (full XSUAA/OAuth/OIDC/BTP destination + cookie hot-reload). No gap; market signal that BTP OAuth is now table stakes. | Evaluated |
| 2026-04-27 | `d7a6f2d`/`df954a3` **Transaction (TRAN/T)** ADT mapper + CLI create (type-specific params) | **Med** | **GAP on write**: ARC-1 reads TRAN (VIT metadata) but has no write. Maps to roadmap **FEAT-62** (already tracking, triggered by sapcli PR #156); now a merged reference impl for the create envelope. | ⛔ **HARD BLOCKER (2026-06-25)**: `/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/tran` 404s on 758 + 816, absent from discovery on all three test systems — no backend to build/verify against. FEAT-62 stays tracked. |
| 2026-04-25 | abapCheckRun-before-save — `4bdc55b` helper, `0fc65b7` `check_before_save`, `--check`/`--skip-check`, `SAPCLI_CHECK_BEFORE_SAVE` | No | **ALREADY-HAVE**: ARC-1 has `SAP_CHECK_BEFORE_WRITE` (SAP-side pre-write syntax check) + `SAP_LINT_BEFORE_WRITE` (abaplint). Direct parity. | Done |
| 2026-04-24 | `942d70b` AUnit **Branch + Procedure coverage** printing + `238be0b` `--skip-covered` | **High** | **GAP (tracked)**: ARC-1 runs unit tests with `coverage active="false"` hardcoded (`devtools.ts:554`) → pass/fail only. sapcli is now a reference impl. → roadmap **FEAT-31/FEAT-41**. | ✅ **DONE (FEAT-41) — PR #503**: `SAPDiagnose unittest coverage:true` returns statement/branch/procedure %; live-verified 758 + 816. |
| 2026-04-21 | `8a3f309`/`f072f38` DDL **API Release** ops + `874c3b3` `ddl apistate set --auth-values` | **Med** | **GAP on write**: ARC-1 *reads* API state (`getApiReleaseState`, FEAT-02) but cannot *set/release* the C1 contract. Now in BOTH sapcli AND vibing-steampunk → strong clean-core dual-signal. → roadmap (extend FEAT-02). | ✅ **DONE (FEAT-02 follow-up) — PR #506**: `SAPManage set_api_state` releases/revokes the C1 contract (narrow v10 GET→PUT transform); live-verified 758 + 816. |
| 2026-04-22 | `af62bfd` normalize CRLF in `Class.Include.text`; `927d7ac` ATC finding location in HUMAN output | No | ARC-1 deliberately *preserves/defaults* CRLF (`class-structure.ts:34`) — the opposite choice, by design (matches what SAP returns). ATC location already in ARC-1 output. | Evaluated |
| 2026-04-12 | `a606f05` ADT Object class anatomy documentation — "Because AI agents are always trying to access object metadata the wrong way" | Medium | Insightful: AI agents commonly misuse ADT metadata access. Review ARC-1's object metadata patterns. | Evaluated |

| 2026-04-11 | `a04fc91` CLI: Data element HUMAN format support | Low | ARC-1 already returns structured DTEL data. | Done |
| 2026-04-11 | `c014f0b` merged (PR [#149](https://github.com/jfilak/sapcli/pull/149)): tree-wide domain support (DOMA) | Low | ARC-1 already supports DOMA read+write. | Done |

_Last updated: 2026-06-24 (deep scan: ~100 commits since 2026-04-12). Net: 3 write-gaps that map to/extend existing roadmap items — TRAN write (FEAT-62), AUnit coverage (FEAT-31/FEAT-41), CDS API-release write (extend FEAT-02, now dual-signal with vibing-steampunk); BDEF behavior-extension create is a new Track item. Confirmed ALREADY-HAVE: MSAG write, uppercase `adtcore:responsible`, package `--package-type`/recordChanges, pre-write check, BTP OAuth. CRLF normalization = deliberately opposite (no action)._
