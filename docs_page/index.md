# ARC-1 — SAP ADT MCP Server

**Enterprise-ready proxy between AI clients and SAP systems.**

ARC-1 is a TypeScript MCP server (distributed as an npm package and Docker image) that implements the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) and translates AI tool calls into [SAP ABAP Development Tools (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-development-tools-user-guide/about-abap-development-tools) REST API requests. It works with Claude, GitHub Copilot, VS Code, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Why ARC-1?

As an **admin**, you control what the AI can and cannot do via positive-opt-in flags:

- Default deny for every mutation; admin explicitly enables writes, transport writes, git writes, data preview, and freestyle SQL separately
- Package allowlist restricts writes to `$TMP`, `Z*`, or any pattern
- `SAP_DENY_ACTIONS` blocks individual actions (e.g. `SAPWrite.delete`) for admins who need a finer scalpel
- Every tool call audited with user identity; per-user scopes (via XSUAA role collections, OIDC JWTs, or API-key profiles) tighten further
- **Layered rate limiting** out of the box — per-IP OAuth edge, per-user MCP quota, server-wide SAP-bound semaphore with `Retry-After` honoring. See the [Rate Limiting Guide](rate-limiting.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no install needed)
npx arc-1@latest --url https://your-sap-host:44300 --user YOUR_USER

# Or install globally
npm install -g arc-1
arc1 --url https://your-sap-host:44300 --user YOUR_USER

# Or use Docker
docker run -e SAP_URL=https://host:44300 -e SAP_USER=dev -e SAP_PASSWORD=secret \
  ghcr.io/marianfoo/arc-1
```

### BTP ABAP Environment

For SAP BTP ABAP (Steampunk) systems, use a service key instead of username/password:

```bash
SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/service-key.json arc1
```

A browser opens for login (OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow). See **[btp-abap-environment.md](btp-abap-environment.md)** for full setup.

## Connect Your Client

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "arc-1@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "your-username",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**ARC-1 is read-only by default** — no writes, no free SQL, no table preview, no transport actions. To change that, edit the same `env` block that starts ARC-1. For example, `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true` keeps the server read-only but enables SQL + named table preview. The example below shows the "everything on" variant (writes + SQL + transports + all packages):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "arc-1@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "your-username",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100",
        "SAP_ALLOW_WRITES": "true", "SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW": "true", "SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL": "true", "SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES": "true",
        "SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES": "*"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Pick the lightest combination that gets your work done. Common starting points:

- **Read/search only**: nothing — defaults are already read-only.
- **Read + data preview + SQL**: `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true`, `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true`.
- **Developer (writes to $TMP/Z*)**: `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`, `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='$TMP,Z*'`, optionally `SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=true` for CTS.

See [authorization.md](authorization.md) for the three-layer model and the full [capability requirements](authorization.md#capability-requirements).

### Claude Code

Add `.mcp.json` to your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "arc-1@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "your-username",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### GitHub Copilot / VS Code

For local stdio mode, use the same `npx` command shape shown above. VS Code's `servers` form looks like this:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sap": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "arc-1@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "your-username",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTP Streamable mode, start arc1 as an HTTP server, then point your MCP client to it:

```bash
SAP_URL=https://host:44300 SAP_USER=dev SAP_PASSWORD=secret \
  npx arc-1@latest --transport http-streamable --http-addr 0.0.0.0:3000
```

Add to VS Code / Copilot MCP config:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sap": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For VS Code / Copilot HTTP mode, safety flags go on the ARC-1 startup command, not in the MCP JSON. Example: `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true npx arc-1@latest --transport http-streamable ...`

HTTP Streamable is also the transport for **Copilot Studio** (Microsoft Power Platform integrations).

### Other MCP Clients

All MCP clients that support stdio work out of the box — just point them at `npx arc-1`.

## Tools

ARC-1 exposes 12 intent-based tools via MCP, designed for AI agents like Copilot Studio.

Full reference: **[tools.md](tools.md)**

## Testing & CI

- **1,300+ unit tests** run locally without SAP access (`npm test`)
- **Integration + E2E lanes** run on `main` pushes and internal PRs in GitHub Actions
- **BTP tests** are local-only (`npm run test:integration:btp`, `npm run test:integration:btp:smoke`)
- **Reliability telemetry + coverage** are collected as informational CI signals

## Admin Controls (Safety)

Safe by default - read-only, no SQL, no data preview, no transport writes, no Git writes. Writes are restricted to `$TMP`.

Every capability is a separate positive opt-in flag:

- **Nothing**: read / search / navigate / lint / diagnose work out of the box.
- `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true` + `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true`: enable named table preview and freestyle SQL.
- `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true` + `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='$TMP,Z*'`: enable object writes to `$TMP` and `Z*` packages.
- Add `SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=true` for CTS transport mutations, `SAP_ALLOW_GIT_WRITES=true` for abapGit / gCTS pushes.

The three-layer model (server flag + user scope + SAP authorization) is described in [authorization.md](authorization.md). Full flag reference: [configuration-reference.md](configuration-reference.md).

## SAP API Policy alignment

The April 2026 [SAP API Policy](https://help.sap.com/doc/sap-api-policy/latest/en-US/API_Policy_latest.pdf) is accompanied by an [SAP API Policy FAQ](https://www.sap.com/documents/2026/04/e2a0665e-4c7f-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html). The FAQ explicitly endorses ADT-based developer tooling — including "**custom developer utilities built on the documented Eclipse Java SDK for internal development automation such as code checks, build processes, and transport management**". ARC-1 used for internal development matches that scope.

ARC-1 is designed to stay within the ADT development-tooling scope described in SAP's API Policy FAQ v1.1. It uses documented ADT / Eclipse SDK capabilities for internal development-related use cases and does not expose ADT Data Preview, SQL execution, table reads, or business-data extraction.

When ARC-1 is used with AI assistants or MCP clients, customers should apply additional governance for AI-driven or automated access patterns, including real user identity, authorization checks, audit logging, rate limits, conservative tool exposure, and customer-side review against SAP documentation and agreements.

The same FAQ excludes "**programmatic reading of application tables or export of business data, SQL execution against SAP backend systems, business data integration or runtime orchestration, agentic AI workflows operating on business data, or substitution for business APIs**". Two ARC-1 capabilities fall outside the endorsed development tooling scope and are **off by default** behind explicit opt-in env vars:

| Capability | Env var to enable | Default | Why it is gated |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Named table content preview (`SAPRead(type=TABLE_CONTENTS)`) | `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true` | `false` (off) | Application-table reads / business-data export are excluded by the FAQ. |
| Freestyle ABAP SQL (`SAPQuery`) | `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true` | `false` (off) | SQL against SAP backend systems is excluded by the FAQ. |

With both flags at their defaults, ARC-1 stays inside the FAQ envelope for endorsed development tooling. Turning either flag on is a customer decision against the policy, the SAP agreement, and your data-protection rules — not the recommended productive default.
