# Authentication Overview

ARC-1 has two independent authentication concerns that work together:

1. **MCP Client → ARC-1**: How does the AI client (Claude, Cursor, Copilot Studio) prove its identity to ARC-1?
2. **ARC-1 → SAP**: How does ARC-1 authenticate to the SAP system?

These are separate layers. You choose one method for each, and they combine freely. This guide helps you understand the options, pick the right combination, and find the detailed setup instructions.

For **what users can do** after authenticating (scopes, roles, safety controls), see [Authorization & Roles](authorization.md).

```
┌─────────────┐      MCP Client Auth       ┌─────────┐      SAP Auth        ┌─────────────┐
│  AI Client  │ ──────────────────────────► │  ARC-1  │ ──────────────────► │ SAP System  │
│  (Claude,   │  API Key, OIDC/JWT,        │  Server │  Basic Auth,        │ (ABAP, BTP) │

```

## Choosing Your Setup

### Quick Decision Guide

After starting, check the server's first INFO log line: `auth: MCP=[...] SAP=[...]`. This is the authoritative summary of what's active.

| Your situation | MCP Client → ARC-1 | ARC-1 → SAP | Setup Guide |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Local dev** (single user, `npx`) | None needed | Basic Auth | [Quickstart](quickstart.md) |
| **Local dev + RFC/SAProuter-only access** | None needed | Local ADT-to-RFC bridge | [Local bridge](#local-adt-to-rfc-bridge-rfcsaprouter-only-local-systems) |
| **Shared server** (team, quick start) | API Key | Basic Auth | [API Key Setup](api-key-setup.md) |
| **Team server** (role-based access) | API Keys (multi) | Basic Auth | [API Key Setup](api-key-setup.md) |
| **Enterprise** (per-user identity) | OIDC / JWT | Basic Auth (shared user) | [OAuth / JWT Setup](oauth-jwt-setup.md) |
| **Enterprise + SAP audit trail** | OIDC / JWT | Principal Propagation | [OAuth / JWT](oauth-jwt-setup.md) + [PP Setup](principal-propagation-setup.md) |
| **BTP Cloud Foundry + on-prem SAP** | XSUAA OAuth | Principal Propagation via Destination Service / Cloud Connector | [XSUAA Setup](xsuaa-setup.md) + [Destination Setup](btp-destination-setup.md) |
| **BTP Cloud Foundry + BTP ABAP Environment** | XSUAA OAuth | Per-user destination (`OAuth2UserTokenExchange`) | [BTP ABAP Setup](btp-abap-environment.md) |
| **BTP ABAP Environment** (local) | None (stdio) | Service-key browser OAuth | [BTP ABAP Setup](btp-abap-environment.md) |

### Recommended: One SAP Identity Model per Instance

For production, the recommended baseline keeps each ARC-1 instance on one SAP identity model:

- **Per-user instance:** XSUAA/OIDC JWT + `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` + explicit `SAP_PP_STRICT=true`.
  In this topology every tool call reaches SAP as the propagated human user.
- **Automation/shared instance:** API keys + `SAP_PP_ENABLED=false` + a dedicated, least-privileged
  technical SAP user or destination. Give it its own safety ceiling, package allowlist, and route.

PP and API keys can also coexist in one fully supported instance. Set `SAP_PP_STRICT=false`
explicitly; JWT calls use PP and API-key calls use the shared technical SAP identity. Separate
instances remain the recommendation when clearer audit, authorization, operational ownership, and
credential boundaries are preferred, but separation is not mandatory.

### What to Consider

**How many users?**

- **Single user** (local dev): No MCP client auth needed. Use Basic Auth to SAP.
- **Small team** (shared server): API Key is the simplest. For role differentiation, use [multiple API keys](api-key-setup.md#multi-key-setup-role-based-access) with per-key profiles.
- **Enterprise** (many users, compliance): Use OIDC or XSUAA. Per-user tokens enable per-user [scopes and roles](authorization.md).

**Do you need per-user SAP identity?**

- **No** (most setups): ARC-1 connects to SAP with a single shared user. Simpler to set up, but all operations appear as one SAP user in logs.
- **Yes** (audit, compliance): Use a per-user BTP Destination path. For on-premise SAP, that means [Principal Propagation](principal-propagation-setup.md) through Connectivity Service + Cloud Connector. For BTP ABAP Environment, use `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` as described in [BTP ABAP Setup](btp-abap-environment.md). Each MCP user maps to their SAP user.

**Where does ARC-1 run?**

- **Locally** (npx, npm): MCP client connects via stdio. No network auth needed.
- **Remote server / Docker**: MCP client connects via HTTP. Needs MCP Client Auth (API Key or OIDC).
- **SAP BTP Cloud Foundry**: XSUAA handles MCP client auth. Destination Service and, for on-premise systems, Connectivity Service / Cloud Connector handle SAP connectivity.

---

## MCP Client Authentication (Client → ARC-1)

These methods control who can talk to ARC-1 when it runs as an HTTP server. Not needed for local stdio connections.

### No Authentication (Local / stdio)

When using ARC-1 locally via `npx` or `npm`, the MCP client connects through stdio (standard input/output). No network auth is needed — security relies on the user's OS-level access.

**Upsides:** Zero setup. Works immediately.
**Downsides:** No per-user identity. No authorization scopes - only the [server ceiling](authorization.md#where-to-set-things) applies.
**When to use:** Local development, personal use.

### API Key

A shared secret token. Simple to set up, no external IdP needed. Supports **multiple keys with per-key profiles** for role-based access control.

**Upsides:** Simplest server auth. Works with any MCP client. No IdP needed. Per-key profiles enable role-based access without an external auth provider.
**Downsides:** Keys identify roles, not individual users. No per-user SAP audit trail. Key rotation requires updating clients.
**When to use:** Small-to-medium teams, POCs, internal servers behind a VPN. Multi-key mode works well for team servers with 2–3 access levels.
**Prerequisites:** Generate random keys, configure server and clients.

**Setup:** [API Key Setup](api-key-setup.md)

### OIDC / JWT (External Identity Provider)

Per-user authentication via any [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) provider (Microsoft Entra ID, Google, Okta, Keycloak, Auth0, etc.). Users authenticate with their corporate identity. Tokens carry per-user [scopes](authorization.md#user-scopes) for fine-grained authorization.

**Upsides:** Per-user identity. Per-user scopes. Works with existing corporate IdPs. Standard protocol.
**Downsides:** Requires an OIDC provider. Token rotation is automatic (refresh tokens) but initial setup is more complex.
**When to use:** Enterprise deployments with existing identity infrastructure.
**Prerequisites:** An OIDC provider with app registration. Configure scopes in IdP to match ARC-1's scope model.

**Setup:** [OAuth / JWT Setup](oauth-jwt-setup.md)

### XSUAA OAuth (SAP BTP)

SAP's own OAuth service for BTP applications. Similar to OIDC but uses SAP's [Authorization and Trust Management Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/what-is-sap-authorization-and-trust-management-service). Scopes and roles are managed in the BTP Cockpit.

**Upsides:** Native BTP integration. Scopes and roles managed in BTP Cockpit. Supports [role collections](authorization.md#btp-xsuaa-role-templates) for easy user management. MCP clients auto-discover the OAuth configuration.
**Downsides:** Only available on BTP. More complex setup than API Key.
**When to use:** BTP Cloud Foundry deployments.
**Prerequisites:** BTP subaccount with XSUAA service instance.

**Setup:** [XSUAA Setup](xsuaa-setup.md)

---

## SAP Authentication (ARC-1 → SAP)

These methods control how ARC-1 proves its identity to the SAP system.

### Basic Authentication

Username and password sent with every HTTP request to SAP. The simplest SAP auth method.

**Upsides:** Zero SAP-side setup. Works with any SAP system.
**Downsides:** Credentials stored in config. Single SAP user for all MCP users. No per-user audit trail.
**When to use:** Local dev, shared servers where SAP identity doesn't matter.
**Prerequisites:** A SAP user with appropriate authorization (see [Authorization & Roles](authorization.md#the-model-in-one-picture)).

```bash
arc1 --url http://sap:50000 --user DEVELOPER --password secret
```

### Cookie Authentication

Reuse session cookies from a browser session. Useful for one-off sessions.

**Upsides:** No stored credentials. Reuses existing browser session.
**Downsides:** Cookies expire (typically 30 minutes). Manual process.
**When to use:** Quick one-off sessions using an existing SAP GUI/Fiori session.

```bash
arc1 --url http://sap:50000 --cookie-file cookies.txt
```

### Local ADT-to-RFC Bridge (RFC/SAProuter-only Local Systems)

ARC-1 speaks ADT over HTTP. If your laptop cannot reach the SAP ADT HTTP(S) endpoint, but Eclipse ADT works through RFC/SAProuter, you can run a local bridge that exposes a loopback HTTP endpoint and forwards ADT REST requests through RFC. One open-source option is [`enricoandreoli/adt-rfc-bridge`](https://github.com/enricoandreoli/adt-rfc-bridge), which forwards requests through SAP's `SADT_REST_RFC_ENDPOINT`.

**Upsides:** Lets local HTTP-only ADT clients work against RFC/SAProuter-only systems. No ARC-1 code or SAP-side installation required when the RFC ADT path already works.
**Downsides:** Local-only workaround. Requires SAP NW RFC SDK + PyRFC. SAP sees the RFC user configured in the bridge, not an ARC-1 propagated end user. Not a replacement for BTP Destination Service, Cloud Connector, or Principal Propagation in team/enterprise deployments.
**When to use:** One local developer, direct ADT HTTP(S) is blocked, Eclipse ADT already works for the same user/client via RFC/SAProuter.

**Setup:** See [Detailed SAP Authentication Reference -> Local ADT-to-RFC Bridge](#3-local-adt-to-rfc-bridge-local-rfcsaprouter-workaround).

### OAuth2 / Service Key (BTP ABAP Environment, local interactive)

For local SAP BTP ABAP Environment development, ARC-1 can use a service key for OAuth2 authentication. Handles token lifecycle (refresh, retry) automatically. Requires an interactive browser login on first use and binds the callback to local loopback, so this is not the deployed/shared-server path.

**Upsides:** Secure OAuth flow. Automatic token refresh. Works with BTP ABAP systems.
**Downsides:** Requires service key from BTP Cockpit. Interactive login on first use.
**When to use:** One local developer connecting to a BTP ABAP Environment (Steampunk) system via stdio.
**Prerequisites:** BTP ABAP instance with service key. See [BTP ABAP Setup](btp-abap-environment.md).

```bash
arc1 --btp-service-key-file /path/to/service-key.json
```

### Principal Propagation / Per-User Destination (Per-User SAP Identity)

The most complete authentication model. Each MCP user's identity flows through to SAP via BTP Destination Service, so every request runs as the real SAP user — not a shared technical account. For on-premise SAP, the destination path uses Connectivity Service + Cloud Connector principal propagation. For BTP ABAP Environment, the destination path uses `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` and sends an ABAP-context bearer token.

**Upsides:** Full per-user audit trail. SAP-level authorization per user. Zero stored SAP credentials. No shared accounts.
**Downsides:** Most complex setup. On-premise requires BTP + Cloud Connector + CERTRULE. BTP ABAP requires a correctly configured OAuth user-token-exchange destination. Requires JWT/XSUAA on the client side.
**When to use:** Enterprise deployments requiring audit compliance, per-user SAP authorization, or regulatory requirements.
**Prerequisites:** BTP Cloud Foundry and Destination Service. Add Connectivity Service, Cloud Connector, and SAP certificate mapping for on-premise systems.

**Setup:** [Principal Propagation Setup](principal-propagation-setup.md)

```
MCP Client ──XSUAA/OIDC JWT──► ARC-1 ──user token──► BTP Destination ──► SAP
```

### BTP Destination Service

For BTP deployments connecting to SAP systems through centrally managed destinations. The Destination Service handles connection details, credentials, and optionally per-user token exchange / principal propagation.

**Upsides:** Centralized connection management. Supports Cloud Connector on-premise routing and BTP ABAP `OAuth2UserTokenExchange`.
**Downsides:** BTP-only. On-premise routing also requires Connectivity Service and Cloud Connector.
**When to use:** BTP Cloud Foundry apps connecting to on-premise SAP via Cloud Connector or to BTP ABAP Environment via `ProxyType=Internet`.
**Prerequisites:** BTP Destination Service instance. Add Cloud Connector only for on-premise targets.

**Setup:** [BTP Destination Setup](btp-destination-setup.md)

## Common Combinations

### Local Developer

```
stdio (no MCP auth) → Basic Auth to SAP
```

Simplest setup. Single user. Leave defaults for read-only access, or set `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true` (plus `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES="$TMP,Z*"`) to enable developer writes.

### Team Server with Role-Based Access

```
API Keys with profiles (MCP auth) → Basic Auth to SAP
```

Quick to set up. Different keys for different roles (e.g., viewer key for reviewers, developer key for developers). All users share one SAP user. Each key enforces its profile's scopes and safety restrictions.

### Enterprise with Per-User Control

```
OIDC (MCP auth) → Basic Auth (shared SAP user)
```

Per-user scopes control what each person can do in ARC-1, but all requests use the same SAP user. Good when SAP identity per user isn't required.

### Enterprise with Full Audit Trail

```
OIDC or XSUAA (MCP auth) → Principal Propagation (per-user SAP identity)
```

Gold standard. Per-user scopes in ARC-1 + per-user SAP authorization + full audit trail. On-premise targets require BTP + Cloud Connector setup; BTP ABAP targets use a cloud-to-cloud `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` destination.

### BTP Cloud Foundry (Production)

```
XSUAA (MCP auth) → BTP Destination Service → Cloud Connector → On-premise SAP
```

Full BTP stack. Role collections in BTP Cockpit. PP optional but recommended for audit compliance.

### BTP Cloud Foundry + BTP ABAP Environment

```
XSUAA (MCP auth) → BTP Destination Service (OAuth2UserTokenExchange) → BTP ABAP Environment
```

Headless BTP-native setup. No Cloud Connector. The destination exchanges the user's XSUAA token for an ABAP bearer token, so SAP-side authorizations apply per user.

## Detailed SAP Authentication Reference

The sections below provide configuration details for each SAP authentication method. For most users, the setup guides above are sufficient — use this reference for advanced configuration or troubleshooting.

---

## 1. Basic Authentication

The simplest method. Username and password are sent with every HTTP request.

```bash
# CLI flags
arc1 --url https://sap-host:443 --user DEVELOPER --password 'ABAPtr2023#00'

# Environment variables
export SAP_URL=https://sap-host:443
export SAP_USER=DEVELOPER
export SAP_PASSWORD='ABAPtr2023#00'
arc1

# .env file (auto-loaded)
SAP_URL=https://sap-host:443
SAP_USER=DEVELOPER
SAP_PASSWORD=ABAPtr2023#00
```

**When to use:** Local development, sandbox systems, CI/CD pipelines with secrets.
**Security:** Password is in plaintext in config/env. Not suitable for production
multi-user deployments.

---

## 2. Cookie Authentication

Reuse session cookies from a browser session (MYSAPSSO2, SAP_SESSIONID).

```bash
# From a cookie file (Netscape format or key=value)
arc1 --url https://sap-host:443 --cookie-file cookies.txt

# From a cookie string
arc1 --url https://sap-host:443 --cookie-string "MYSAPSSO2=abc123; SAP_SESSIONID_A4H_001=xyz"
```

**When to use:** One-off sessions where you have browser cookies.
**Security:** Session cookies expire (typically 30 min). Not scalable.

---

## 3. Local ADT-to-RFC Bridge (Local RFC/SAProuter Workaround)

ARC-1 normally sends ADT REST requests directly to SAP's HTTP(S) endpoint (`/sap/bc/adt/...`). Some local/customer networks allow Eclipse ADT through RFC/SAProuter but do not allow raw HTTP(S) routing to the SAP ICM port. In that case, you can run a local ADT-to-RFC bridge and point ARC-1 at the bridge's localhost URL.

One open-source option is [`enricoandreoli/adt-rfc-bridge`](https://github.com/enricoandreoli/adt-rfc-bridge). It accepts normal ADT HTTP requests on `127.0.0.1`, forwards them via PyRFC through `SADT_REST_RFC_ENDPOINT`, and translates the response back to HTTP.

Use this only when all of these are true:

- Direct ADT HTTP(S) access to SAP is blocked or unavailable.
- RFC/SAProuter access works locally.
- Eclipse ADT already works for the same SAP user and client.
- You are running ARC-1 locally for one user.

You do not need this for normal deployments. If ARC-1 runs as a managed server, prefer BTP Destination Service + Cloud Connector, and use Principal Propagation when SAP must see the real end user.

### Bridge Startup

Install and configure the bridge following its README. The bridge uses `RFC_*` variables for the real SAP RFC logon, for example:

```bash
BRIDGE_PORT=8410
RFC_ASHOST=10.0.0.1
RFC_SYSNR=00
RFC_CLIENT=100
RFC_USER=YOUR_USER
RFC_PASSWD=YOUR_PASS
RFC_SAPROUTER=/H/router.example.com/S/3299
python adt_rfc_bridge.py
```

Then point ARC-1 at the bridge:

```bash
SAP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8410
SAP_USER=YOUR_USER
SAP_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASS
SAP_CLIENT=100
ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT=1
arc1
```

For Claude Desktop, use the same `SAP_URL` value in the `env` block:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "arc-1@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8410",
        "SAP_USER": "YOUR_USER",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "YOUR_PASS",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100",
        "ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security and behavior notes:**

- ARC-1 safety gates still apply: writes, SQL, table preview, transports, and package allowlists remain opt-in.
- SAP sees the RFC user configured in the bridge. This is not ARC-1 Principal Propagation.
- Run one bridge per SAP user/client/port.
- Keep the bridge bound to `127.0.0.1`; do not expose it as a shared service.
- `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT=1` is recommended because the bridge reuses a serialized RFC connection.
- The SAP user needs the RFC authorizations for `SADT_REST_RFC_ENDPOINT` plus the normal ADT resource authorizations.

---

## 4. BTP ABAP Environment (Local Service Key + Browser OAuth)

For local SAP BTP ABAP Environment development. ARC-1 uses a service key for OAuth2 Authorization Code flow with interactive browser login. For deployed BTP CF servers, use the per-user destination setup in [BTP ABAP Environment](btp-abap-environment.md#recommended-btp-deployment-with-a-per-user-destination).

### From a Service Key File

```bash
arc1 --btp-service-key-file /path/to/service-key.json
```

Or inline:

```bash
arc1 --btp-service-key '{"uaa":{"url":"...","clientid":"...","clientsecret":"..."},"url":"https://..."}'
```

The service key JSON is downloaded from SAP BTP Cockpit and looks like:

```json
{
  "url": "https://my-system.abap.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
  "systemid": "DEV",
  "uaa": {
    "url": "https://my-tenant.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
    "clientid": "sb-clone-abc123",
    "clientsecret": "secret-value"
  }
}
```

**Token lifecycle:** ARC-1 opens a browser for initial OAuth login, then caches and refreshes tokens automatically in memory.

**References:**
- [SAP BTP: Create Service Keys](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/creating-service-keys)
- [BTP ABAP Environment Setup](btp-abap-environment.md)

---

## 5. BTP Destination Service

For BTP Cloud Foundry deployments connecting to on-premise SAP systems via Cloud Connector, or to BTP ABAP Environment via `OAuth2UserTokenExchange`.

```bash
export SAP_BTP_DESTINATION=SAP_TRIAL
```

The Destination Service handles connection details, credentials, Cloud Connector Principal Propagation, and BTP ABAP `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` destinations. See [BTP Destination Setup](btp-destination-setup.md).

---

## 6. Per-User Destination (BTP Destination)

Per-user SAP identity for JWT-authenticated users via BTP Destination Service.

```bash
export SAP_BTP_DESTINATION=SAP_TRIAL
export SAP_BTP_PP_DESTINATION=SAP_TRIAL_PP
export SAP_PP_ENABLED=true
export SAP_PP_STRICT=true
```

**How it works:** ARC-1 passes the user's JWT to BTP Destination Service, which resolves the per-user destination. For on-premise SAP, Cloud Connector propagates the user identity via client certificate and SAP maps that certificate to a SAP user via CERTRULE / VUSREXTID. For BTP ABAP Environment, the destination exchanges the user token for an ABAP bearer token.

**Fallback behavior:**
- JWT PP failures always return an error, with no shared-client fallback
- The recommended explicit `SAP_PP_STRICT=true` rejects API-key / non-JWT tool calls
- Explicit `SAP_PP_STRICT=false` enables supported mixed mode but does not enable JWT fallback;
  separate instances remain the recommendation, not a requirement

See [Principal Propagation Setup](principal-propagation-setup.md) for the on-premise Cloud Connector setup, or [BTP ABAP Environment](btp-abap-environment.md#recommended-btp-deployment-with-a-per-user-destination) for the cloud-to-cloud `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` setup.

---

## Custom TLS Trust

When the SAP system uses a TLS server certificate signed by an internal CA
(not a public CA like Let's Encrypt), use `--insecure` or mount the CA certificate
into the Node.js trust store via `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`.

```bash
# Skip TLS verification (development only)
arc1 --url https://sap-host:443 --user DEV --password pass --insecure

# Mount custom CA (production)
NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/internal-ca.crt arc1 --url https://sap-host:443 ...
```

---

## SAML Disable (Advanced, Opt-in)

Some on-prem AS ABAP systems are configured with SAML as the default ICF auth method
even where Basic / cookie auth is also available. ARC-1 can request that SAP skip
the SAML redirect via either a request header (preferred) or a URL query parameter:

```bash
SAP_DISABLE_SAML=true
```

When set, every ADT request adds `X-SAP-SAML2: disabled` (SAP Note 3456236)
and `?saml2=disabled` (SAP KBA 2577263). **Never enable this on BTP ABAP Environment
or S/4HANA Public Cloud** — those systems require SAML, and disabling it breaks login.
ARC-1 emits a warning if you combine `SAP_DISABLE_SAML=true` with
`SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE=btp`.

### HTML login page detection

Independent of the SAML flag, ARC-1 detects when SAP returns a login HTML page
(200 OK + `Content-Type: text/html`) on an ADT endpoint. Instead of trying to parse
HTML as XML, ARC-1 throws a clear `401 — ADT call returned HTML login page` error
with pointers to the common causes (expired cookies, wrong Basic creds, missing
S_ADT_RES authorization, SSO-only system needing `SAP_DISABLE_SAML=true`).

---

## Coexistence Matrix

**Layer A** (MCP client → ARC-1) methods always combine. **Layer B** (ARC-1 → SAP) methods are largely exclusive — the matrix below shows valid combinations.

| Layer B combination | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Basic only | ✅ | Standard on-prem |
| Cookie only | ✅ | On-prem SSO developer loop |
| Basic + Cookie | ✅ | ARC-1 sends both headers — SAP picks |
| Direct service-key bearer (BTP ABAP) only | ✅ | Local BTP ABAP Environment browser OAuth |
| Destination only | ✅ | BTP Cloud Foundry, shared user |
| Destination + PP with explicit `SAP_PP_STRICT=true` | ✅ recommended | Enterprise standard on BTP CF; JWT tool calls use one per-user SAP identity model |
| Destination + PP + API keys with `SAP_PP_STRICT=false` | ✅ supported | JWT calls are per-user while API-key calls use the shared technical identity; separate instances are recommended for clearer boundaries |
| PP + Cookie | ❌ fail-fast | Cookies would leak into per-user requests |
| PP + Cookie + SAP_PP_ALLOW_SHARED_COOKIES=true | ⚠️ allowed with warning | Cookies stay on shared client only |
| Bearer + Cookie | ❌ fail-fast | Two Layer B methods in conflict |
| Direct service-key bearer + PP | ❌ fail-fast | `SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY` is local interactive OAuth and cannot be combined with `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` |
| Destination-exchanged bearer + PP | ✅ | BTP ABAP deployed path: `SAP_BTP_DESTINATION` + `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` + destination `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` |

### SAP Auth Coexistence Rules

ARC-1 enforces these Layer B constraints at startup:

1. `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` with `SAP_COOKIE_FILE` / `SAP_COOKIE_STRING` fails fast unless `SAP_PP_ALLOW_SHARED_COOKIES=true`.
2. `SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY` with `SAP_COOKIE_FILE` / `SAP_COOKIE_STRING` fails fast.
3. `SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY` with `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` fails fast.
4. `SAP_DISABLE_SAML=true` with `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE=btp` emits a warning (startup continues).
5. `ARC1_DCR_SIGNING_SECRET` set without `SAP_XSUAA_AUTH=true` emits a warning (startup continues, secret is unused — only consumed by the XSUAA OAuth proxy path).

MCP client auth (API Key, OIDC, XSUAA) is technically independent from SAP auth. ARC-1 supports API
keys and PP in one instance with explicit `SAP_PP_STRICT=false`; JWT calls use per-user SAP identity
and API-key calls use the shared identity. Separate strict PP and API-key instances are recommended
when one SAP identity model per endpoint is preferable.

### What's NOT Implemented

These flags from older documentation do **not** exist in the current ARC-1 codebase:

- `--client-cert` / `--client-key` / `--ca-cert` (local mTLS)
- `--service-key` / `--oauth-url` / `--oauth-client-id` / `--oauth-client-secret` (generic OAuth)
- `--oidc-username-claim` / `--oidc-user-mapping` (username mapping)
- `--pp-ca-key` / `--pp-ca-cert` / `--pp-cert-ttl` (local ephemeral cert generation)

!!! warning "Audience is required"
    When `--oidc-issuer` is set, `--oidc-audience` must also be set. ARC-1 will refuse to start without an explicit audience to prevent token confusion attacks.

## Troubleshooting

### OIDC token validation fails

**"key ID not found in JWKS"**
- The token was signed with a key that rotated. JWKS cache refreshes every hour.
- Verify the `--oidc-issuer` URL is correct (must match the `iss` claim)

**"JWT audience mismatch"** or **"OIDC audience is required"**
- `SAP_OIDC_AUDIENCE` is mandatory when `SAP_OIDC_ISSUER` is set — ARC-1 will not start without it
- For Entra ID v2.0 tokens (`requestedAccessTokenVersion: 2`), the `aud` claim is the raw client ID GUID
- For Entra ID v1.0 tokens (default), the `aud` claim is `api://{client-id}`
- Set `SAP_OIDC_AUDIENCE` to match what your tokens actually contain
- Check with: `az account get-access-token --scope "api://{client-id}/access_as_user" --query accessToken -o tsv | jwt decode -` (or paste into jwt.ms)

**"JWT issuer mismatch"**
- Microsoft Entra ID v2.0 issuer format: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0`
- Microsoft Entra ID v1.0 issuer format: `https://sts.windows.net/{tenant-id}/`
- Set `requestedAccessTokenVersion: 2` in the app manifest to get v2.0 tokens

### Power Platform / Copilot Studio OAuth errors

**"AADSTS50011" (Reply address mismatch)**
- Each Power Automate connector generates a unique redirect URI
- Copy the exact URI from the connector's Security tab → Umleitungs-URL
- Add it to the Entra ID app registration under Authentication → Web → Redirect URIs

**"AADSTS90009" (Requesting token for itself, use GUID)**
- When an app requests a token for itself (client ID = resource), the Resource URL must be the raw GUID
- Change Resource URL from `api://...` to just the client ID GUID

**"AADSTS90008" (Must require Microsoft Graph access)**
- Add `User.Read` delegated permission from Microsoft Graph
- Grant admin consent: `az ad app permission admin-consent --id {client-id}`

**"Anmelden nicht möglich" / Login popup opens and closes**
- Verify Tenant ID in the connector is the actual tenant GUID, not `common`
- Verify Resource URL is set (not empty)
- Verify the redirect URI is registered in the app registration

### Principal-propagation requests do not use the expected SAP user

- Verify `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` is set
- Verify `SAP_BTP_PP_DESTINATION` authentication type is `PrincipalPropagation` in BTP Cockpit
- Verify Cloud Connector + backend certificate mapping configuration
- Check Cloud Connector logs for PP errors
