# Local Development

Everything for running ARC-1 locally against your own SAP — one developer, one laptop.

Already did the [Quickstart](quickstart.md)? This page is the full toolbox: all install methods, `.env` patterns, MCP client configs, safety profiles, and the cookie extractor for SSO-only on-prem systems.

For multi-user / production deployments see [deployment.md](deployment.md).

---

## Install methods

Pick one — they're equivalent in behaviour, they differ in how you manage the binary.

### npx (zero install)

```bash
npx arc-1@latest --url https://your-sap-host:44300 \
                 --user YOUR_USER --password YOUR_PASS \
                 --client 100
```

npx downloads on first run and caches. Always gets the latest patch. Best for trying things out.

### npm install -g (faster startup)

```bash
npm install -g arc-1
arc1 --url https://your-sap-host:44300 --user YOUR_USER --password YOUR_PASS --client 100
```

Startup is ~1s faster than npx. Update with `npm install -g arc-1@latest`.

### Docker (local)

```bash
docker run -d --name arc1 -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:44300 \
  -e SAP_USER=YOUR_USER \
  -e SAP_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASS \
  -e SAP_CLIENT=100 \
  ghcr.io/marianfoo/arc-1:latest
```

Defaults to HTTP Streamable on `:8080`. Connect MCP clients to `http://localhost:8080/mcp`. Full Docker reference → [docker.md](docker.md).

For stdio mode inside Docker (Claude Desktop wraps the `docker run` in the MCP config), add `-e SAP_TRANSPORT=stdio` and use `docker run -i --rm` instead of `-d`.

### git clone (contributing or running from source)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marianfoo/arc-1.git
cd arc-1
npm ci
cp .env.example .env       # then edit for your SAP system

# Pick one:
npm run dev                # stdio, tsx auto-reload (development loop)
npm run dev:http           # builds + runs HTTP streamable on 0.0.0.0:8080
npm run build && npm start # production-style: compile to dist/, run from there
```

| Script | What it does | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | `tsx src/index.ts` — runs from source over stdio. No build step; restarts on file change. | Iterating on stdio-mode code; pairing with `node` debugger. |
| `npm run dev:http` | `npm run build && tsx src/index.ts --transport http-streamable` | Iterating on HTTP-mode code; testing OAuth/XSUAA flows; pointing remote MCP clients at your laptop. |
| `npm run build` | `tsc` + copies AFF schemas to `dist/`. | Producing the `dist/index.js` you ship in Docker or invoke as `node dist/index.js`. |
| `npm start` | `node dist/index.js` (assumes you ran `npm run build` first). | Production-equivalent local run; useful when you want to test the same artifact CI publishes. |

All four read `.env` from the repo root (their CWD). CLI flags and shell env vars override `.env` — see [Where do my config values come from?](#where-do-my-config-values-come-from) below.

---

## Using a `.env` file

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and uncomment what you need. Priority is CLI > env > `.env` > defaults.

Minimal `.env` for basic auth:

```bash
SAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:44300
SAP_USER=YOUR_USER
SAP_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASS
SAP_CLIENT=100
SAP_LANGUAGE=EN
```

**The `.env` file loads automatically for `npm run dev`, `npm start`, and the `arc1` CLI.** For `npx` and Docker, pass values as env vars or flags instead.

Full grouped template with every option: see [`.env.example`](https://github.com/marianfoo/arc-1/blob/main/.env.example). The file is grouped into Layer B (ARC-1 → SAP) and Layer A (MCP Client → ARC-1) blocks with fail-fast rules documented inline.

### Where do my config values come from?

ARC-1 resolves every config field from four sources, in order: **CLI flag > `process.env` > `.env` file (in CWD) > built-in default**. The `.env` file is loaded by dotenv from the running process's CWD and **never overrides values already in `process.env`** — it only fills in missing keys.

What `process.env` contains depends on how you launched ARC-1:

- **`npm run dev` / `npm start` from a shell** — your shell exports + the repo's `.env`. Shell wins over `.env`.
- **`npx arc-1` from an MCP client (stdio)** — the `env` block in your `mcp.json` / `claude_desktop_config.json` becomes the subprocess's environment. There's no `.env` involved.
- **Remote HTTP — MCP client connects via `"url"`** — only the server's startup environment matters. Putting `env:` in mcp.json next to a `url:` does **nothing**.
- **Docker / BTP CF** — `-e` flags, `--env-file`, `cf set-env`, manifest properties, and `VCAP_SERVICES`. No `.env` inside containers.

Full per-mode table + debugging tips: [Configuration Precedence](configuration-precedence.md).

---

## MCP client configuration

All MCP clients that speak stdio work the same way — they spawn `npx arc-1` as a subprocess and talk JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout. The `env` block is where credentials and safety flags go, for example `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES`, `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL`, and `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES`.

### Claude Desktop

`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "arc-1@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "YOUR_USER",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "YOUR_PASS",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To keep the same local setup but allow SQL + named table preview while staying read-only, add `"SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW": "true", "SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL": "true"` inside that same `env` block.

### Claude Code

Project-scoped: create `.mcp.json` in the repo root with the same shape as above. User-scoped: `~/.claude.json` with a `mcpServers` block.

### Cursor

Cursor Settings → MCP — same JSON shape as Claude Desktop.

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

For local stdio mode, use the same shape as Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sap": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "arc-1@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "YOUR_USER",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "YOUR_PASS",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a long-running local server or shared endpoint, run ARC-1 as an HTTP Streamable server:

```bash
npx arc-1@latest --url https://host:44300 --user dev --password secret \
                 --client 100 \
                 --transport http-streamable --http-addr 127.0.0.1:3000
```

Then in VS Code MCP settings:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sap": { "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp" }
  }
}
```

If you want `viewer-sql` in VS Code / Copilot, change the command that starts ARC-1, not the MCP JSON. The JSON only tells VS Code where the already-running server lives:

```bash
SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true \
npx arc-1@latest --url https://host:44300 --user dev --password secret \
                 --client 100 \
                 --transport http-streamable --http-addr 127.0.0.1:3000
```

> For a local loop, bind to `127.0.0.1` not `0.0.0.0` — stops other machines on the network from hitting your instance. If you bind `0.0.0.0`, add an API key: see [api-key-setup.md](api-key-setup.md).

### Gemini CLI / Goose / OpenCode / other stdio clients

Same pattern: spawn `npx -y arc-1@latest` with the same `env` block. All stdio clients are interchangeable.

### Pointing an MCP client at a locally-built instance

When you're iterating on ARC-1 itself (or just want to skip the npx download), point the client at your local clone instead.

**Stdio against compiled `dist/`** — closest to what the published package does. Run `npm run build` first.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sap-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/arc-1/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SAP_URL": "https://your-sap-host:44300",
        "SAP_USER": "dev",
        "SAP_PASSWORD": "secret",
        "SAP_CLIENT": "100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`.env` is **not** read here unless you set `"cwd": "/absolute/path/to/arc-1"` in the same block — dotenv looks at the subprocess CWD. Either set `cwd`, or pass everything via `env`.

**Stdio against `tsx` (no build step)** — handy while iterating on source.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sap-local": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/absolute/path/to/arc-1/src/index.ts"],
      "env": { "SAP_URL": "…", "SAP_USER": "…", "SAP_PASSWORD": "…", "SAP_CLIENT": "100" }
    }
  }
}
```

**HTTP against a long-running `npm run dev:http`** — useful for testing OAuth/XSUAA or sharing one instance across multiple clients. Start the server in a terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/arc-1
npm run dev:http -- --http-addr 127.0.0.1:3000     # reads .env from repo root
```

Then point any MCP client at the URL:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "sap-local": { "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp" }
  }
}
```

> For local HTTP loops, bind to `127.0.0.1` (not `0.0.0.0`) so other machines on your network can't hit the instance. If you bind `0.0.0.0`, add an API key — see [api-key-setup.md](api-key-setup.md).

In HTTP mode, the `env` block in mcp.json **does nothing** — the server already has its own environment from when you launched `npm run dev:http`. Change config by editing `.env` (or shell-exporting) and restarting the server. Full mode-by-mode breakdown: [Configuration Precedence](configuration-precedence.md).

## Safety flags

ARC-1 ships read-only. For local development, enable only what you need via positive-opt-in flags.

### What's blocked by default

| Capability                 | Default | Opt-in flag                           |
|----------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| Object writes              | off     | `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`               |
| Named table preview        | off     | `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true`         |
| Freestyle SQL              | off     | `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true`             |
| Transport mutations        | off     | `SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=true` (also needs `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`) |
| Git mutations              | off     | `SAP_ALLOW_GIT_WRITES=true` (also needs `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`)       |
| Writes to any package       | `$TMP` only | `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='$TMP,Z*'` (or `*` for any) |

Transport reads (list / get / check / history) and Git reads (list_repos / whoami / branches / ...) work without any opt-in flag — only mutations are gated.

### Common local starting points

- **Just explore** (default): no config needed.
- **Table preview + SQL**: `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=true SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true`.
- **Developer**: `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='$TMP,Z*'` — optionally add `SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=true` or `SAP_ALLOW_GIT_WRITES=true`.
- **Full local dev**: all 5 `SAP_ALLOW_*=true` + `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='*'` (quote the `*` in shell so it isn't expanded to filenames).

For fine-grained blocking even after the above flags are set, use `SAP_DENY_ACTIONS` — e.g. `SAP_DENY_ACTIONS="SAPWrite.delete,SAPManage.flp_*"`. See [authorization.md](authorization.md#advanced-deny-actions).

## SSO-only on-prem: cookie extractor

> ⚠️ **Developer-only escape hatch.** Single user, short-lived session, never for deployed / shared instances. The script refuses to run if `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true`.

Some corporate on-prem SAP systems return an HTML login page on `/sap/bc/adt/` instead of accepting Basic Auth — typically when SAML2 / SPNEGO / X.509 / Kerberos SSO is enforced. You're expected to authenticate through a browser.

For a single-developer local loop, the included extractor scrapes your existing SAP session cookies from Chrome and writes them to a file ARC-1 can reuse:

```bash
npm run extract-sap-cookies -- --url https://your-sap-host:44300
```

What it does:

1. Launches Chrome with remote-debugging enabled (CDP).
2. You complete your normal SSO login in the browser window (IdP redirect, MFA, whatever your corp flow is).
3. The script reads the SAP session cookies (`SAP_SESSIONID_*`, `MYSAPSSO2`, `sap-usercontext`) out of Chrome.
4. Writes them to `cookies.txt` with mode `0600`.

Then point ARC-1 at the cookie file:

```bash
export SAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:44300
export SAP_COOKIE_FILE=$PWD/cookies.txt
npx arc-1@latest
```

Startup log:

```
INFO: auth: MCP=[none] SAP=cookie (shared)
```

### When to use it

- ✅ SSO-only on-prem SAP, solo developer loop.
- ✅ Your IdP enforces MFA / X.509 client certs that can't be scripted.
- ❌ Multi-user / deployed ARC-1 — cookies are one user's session.
- ❌ BTP ABAP Environment — use [service-key OAuth](btp-abap-environment.md).
- ❌ Combined with `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` — the extractor refuses, and ARC-1 fails at startup unless the explicit escape-hatch `SAP_PP_ALLOW_SHARED_COOKIES=true` is set.

### Limitations

- Cookies expire (usually minutes to hours). Re-run the script to refresh.
- SAP sees whichever user you logged in as, not "the MCP caller" — fine for solo dev, wrong for a shared service.
- No refresh token — you get whatever session the browser has.

For per-user SAP identity with a deployed ARC-1, use a **per-user BTP Destination**: Cloud Connector Principal Propagation for on-premise SAP, or `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` for BTP ABAP Environment. See [deployment.md](deployment.md).

---

## What you get at startup

Every ARC-1 startup prints a one-line auth summary on stderr:

```
INFO: auth: MCP=[none] SAP=basic (shared)
INFO: auth: MCP=[api-key] SAP=cookie (shared)
INFO: auth: MCP=[oidc] SAP=pp (per-user) [disable-saml=on]
```

This line tells you which Layer A / Layer B methods are active. If it disagrees with what you thought you configured, that's the first place to look.

## CLI usage (outside MCP)

Sometimes you just want to shell-test an ADT endpoint without running the full MCP server:

```bash
# Works off .env
npm run cli -- search ZCL_CUSTOMER
npm run cli -- source clas ZCL_CUSTOMER

# Verbose (shows every HTTP request)
SAP_VERBOSE=true npm run cli -- search ZCL_CUSTOMER
```
